 Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is a group of defects passed down through families. The disorder involves the skin, nervous system, eyes, endocrine glands, urinary and reproductive systems, and bones.It causes an unusual facial appearance and a higher risk for skin cancers and noncancerous tumors.Causes

Nevoid basal cell carcinoma nevus syndrome is a rare genetic condition. The main gene linked to the syndrome is known as PTCH ("patched"). A second gene, called SUFU, has also been associated with this condition.Abnormalities in these genes are most commonly passed down through families as an autosomal dominant trait. This means youÂ develop the syndrome if either parent passes the gene to you. If either of your parents has this syndrome, you have a 50 percent chance of having it. It is also possible to develop this gene defect with no family history.Symptoms

Main symptoms of this disorder are:A type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that develops around the time of pubertyA noncancerous tumor of the jaw, called kerotocystic odontogenic tumor that also develops during pubertyOther symptoms include:Broad noseCleft palateHeavy, protruding browJaw that sticks out (in some cases)Wide-set eyes Pitting on palms and solesThe condition may affect the nervous system and lead to:Eye problemsDeafnessIntellectual disabilitySeizuresTumors of the brainThe condition also leads to bone defects, including:Curvature of the back (scoliosis)Severe curvature of the back (kyphosis) Abnormal ribsExams and Tests

There may be a family history of this disorder and a past history of basal cell skin cancers.Tests may reveal:Brain tumorsCysts in the jaw, which can lead to abnormal tooth development or jaw fracturesDefects in the colored part (iris) or lens of the eyeHead swelling due to fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus)Rib abnormalitiesTests that may be done include:Echocardiogram of the heartGenetic testing (in some patients)MRI of the brainSkin biopsy of tumorsX-rays of the bones, teeth, and skullUltrasound to check for ovarian tumorsTreatment

It is important to get examined by a skin doctor (dermatologist) often, so that skin cancers may be treated while they are still small.People with this disorder may also be seen and treated by other specialists, depending on which part of the body is affected. For example, a cancer specialist (oncologist) may treat tumors in the body, and an orthopedic surgeon may help treat bone problems.Outlook (Prognosis)

Frequent follow-up with a variety of specialist doctors is important for having a good outcome.Possible Complications

People with this condition may develop:BlindnessBrain tumorDeafnessFracturesOvarian tumorsCardiac fibromasSkin damage and severe scarring due to skin cancers When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider for an appointment if:You or any family members have nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, especially if you are planning to have a child.You have a child who has symptoms of this disorder.Prevention

Couples with a family history of this syndrome might consider genetic counseling before becoming pregnant.Staying out of the sun and using sunscreen can help prevent new basal cell skin cancers.Avoid radiation such as x-rays. People with this condition are very sensitive to radiation. Exposure to radiation can lead to skin cancers.Alternative Names

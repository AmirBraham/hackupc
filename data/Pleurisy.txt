 Pleurisy is an inflammation of the lining of the lungs and chest (the pleura) that leads to chest pain when you take a breath or cough.Causes

Pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infection, such as a viral infection, pneumonia, or tuberculosis. It may also occur with:Certain cancersChest traumaBlood clot (pulmonary embolus)
   Rheumatoid arthritisLupus (systemic lupus erythematosus)Symptoms

The main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest. This pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out, or cough. Some people feel the pain in the shoulder.Deep breathing, coughing, and chest movement make the pain worse.Pleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest. As a result, the following symptoms can occur:CoughingShortness of breathRapid breathingPain with deep breathsExams and Tests

When you have pleurisy, the normally smooth surfaces lining the lung (the pleura) become rough. They rub together with each breath. This results in a rough, grating sound called a friction rub. Your health care provider may hear this sound with the stethoscope.Your provider may order the following tests:
   Complete blood count (CBC)X-ray of the chestCT scan of the chestUltrasound of the chestRemoval of pleural fluid with a needle (thoracentesis) for analysis Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause of the pleurisy. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. Surgery or insertion of a tube in the chest may be needed to drain infected fluid from the lungs. Viral infections normally run their course without medicines.Taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain.Outlook (Prognosis)

Recovery depends on the cause of the pleurisy and your general health condition.Possible Complications

Health problems that may develop from pleurisy include:Breathing difficultyFluid buildup between chest wall and lungComplications from the original illnessWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

 Stasis dermatitis is a change in the skin that results from the pooling of blood in the veins of the lower leg. Ulcers are open sores that can result from untreated stasis dermatitis.Causes

Venous insufficiency is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart. This may be due to damaged valves that are in the veins.Â Some people with venous insufficiency develop stasis dermatitis. Blood pools in the veins of the lower leg. Fluid and blood cells leak out of the veins into the skin and other tissues. This may lead to itching and inflammation that cause more skin changes. The skin may then break down to form open sores.Symptoms

You may have symptoms of venous insufficiency including:Dull aching or heaviness in the legPain that gets worse when you stand or walkSwelling in the leg At first, the skin of the ankles and lower legs may look thin or tissue-like. You may slowly get brown coloring of the skin.The skin may become irritated or crack if you scratch it. It may also become red or swollen, crusted, or weepy.Over time, some skin changes become permanent:Thickening and hardening of the skin on the legs and ankles (lipodermatosclerosis)A bumpy or cobblestone appearance of the skinSkin turns dark brown Skin sores (ulcers) may develop (called a venous ulcer or stasis ulcer). These most often form on the inside of the ankle.Exams and Tests

 Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development.Causes

Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of 25 to 27 genes on chromosome number 7.In most cases, the gene changes (mutations) occur on their own, either in the sperm or egg that a baby develops from.However, once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.One of the missing genes is the gene that produces elastin. This is a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition.Symptoms

Symptoms of Williams syndrome are:Feeding problems, including colic, reflux, and vomitingInward bend of the small fingerSunken chestHeart disease or blood vessel problemsDevelopmental delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, learning disordersDelayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearingEasily distracted, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in musicShort, compared to the rest of the person's familyThe face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show:A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned noseLong ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lipProminent lips with an open mouthSkin that covers the inner corner of the eyePartially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Exams and Tests

Signs include:Narrowing of some blood vesselsFarsightednessDental problems, such as teeth that are widely spacedHigh blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid musclesHigh blood pressureLoose joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets olderUnusual star-like pattern in iris of the eyeTests for Williams syndrome include:Blood pressure checkGenetic testing, such as a blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test or microarray)Urine and blood tests for calcium levelEchocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasoundKidney ultrasoundTreatment

There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. Treatment is based on how severe it is.Physical therapy is helpful for people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms.It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome.Support Groups

More information and support for people with Williams syndrome and their families can be found at:Williams Syndrome Association -- williams-syndrome.orgOutlook (Prognosis)

Most people with Williams syndrome:Have some intellectual disability.Will not live as long as normal due to the various medical issues and other possible complications.Require full-time caregivers and often live in supervised group homes.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problemsDeath (in rare cases from anesthesia)Heart failure due to narrowed blood vesselsPain in the abdomen When to Contact a Medical Professional

Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Contact your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome.Prevention

There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive.Alternative Names

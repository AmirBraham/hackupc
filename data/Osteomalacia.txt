 Osteomalacia is softening of the bones. It most often occurs because of a problem with vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. Your body needs calcium to maintain the strength and hardness of your bones.In children, the condition is called rickets.Causes

A lack of the proper amount of calcium in the blood can lead to weak and soft bones. Low blood calcium can be caused by low vitamin D level in the blood.Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D produced by the skin may occur in people who:Live in climates with little exposure to sunlightMust stay indoorsWork indoors during the daylight hoursWear clothes that cover most of their skinHave dark skin pigmentationUse very strong sunscreen You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products)Do not eat or drink milk products (more common in older adults)Follow a vegetarian dietAre not able to absorb vitamin D well in the intestines, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to a gastrointestinal diseaseOther conditions that may cause osteomalacia include:Cancer -- rare tumors that cause low phosphate level in the kidneyKidney failure and acidosisLack of enough phosphates in the dietLiver disease -- the liver cannot convert vitamin D to its active formSide effects of medicines used to treat seizuresSymptoms

Symptoms include:Bone fractures that happen without a real injuryMuscle weaknessWidespread bone pain, especially in the hipsSymptoms may also occur due to low calcium level. These include:Numbness around the mouthNumbness or tingling of the arms and legsSpasms or cramps of the hands or feetExams and Tests

Blood tests will be done to check vitamin D, creatinine, calcium, phosphate, electrolyte, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone levels.Bone x-rays and a bone density test can help detect pseudofractures, bone loss, and bone softening. More importantly, osteomalacia can look like weakening of the bones from osteoporosis on bone density testing.In some cases, a bone biopsy will be done to see if bone softening is present.Treatment

Treatment may involve vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus supplements taken by mouth. People who cannot absorb nutrients well through the intestines may need larger doses of vitamin D and calcium. This includes people who haveÂ some types of weight loss surgery.People with certain conditions may need regular blood tests to monitor blood levels of phosphorus and calcium.Outlook (Prognosis)

Some people with vitamin deficiency disorders will get better within a few weeks. With treatment, healing should happen within 6 months.Possible Complications

Symptoms can return.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of osteomalacia, or if you think that you may be at risk for this disorder.Prevention

Eating a diet rich in vitamin D and calcium and getting sufficient exposure to sunlight can help prevent osteomalacia due to vitamin D deficiency.Alternative Names

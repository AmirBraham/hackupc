Night terrors may run in families. They can occur in adults, especially when there is emotional tension or alcohol use.Symptoms

Night terrors are most common during the first third of the night, often between midnight and 2 a.m.Children often scream and are very frightened and confused.

They often have no memory of the event when they wake up the next day.Children with night terrors may also sleep walk.In contrast, nightmares are more common in the early morning. They may occur after someone watches frightening movies or TV shows, or has an emotional experience. A person may remember the details of a dream after waking up and will not be disoriented after the episode.Exams and Tests

In many cases, no further examination or testing is needed. If night terror episodes occur often, the child should be evaluated by a health care provider. If needed, tests such as a sleep study can be done to rule out a sleep disorder. Treatment

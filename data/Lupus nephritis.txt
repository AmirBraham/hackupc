 Lupus nephritis, which is a kidney disorder, is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus.Causes

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is an autoimmune disease. This means there is a problem with the body's immune system.Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues.SLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead to disorders such as:Interstitial nephritisNephrotic syndromeMembranous glomerulonephritisKidney failure Symptoms

Symptoms of lupus nephritis include:Blood in the urineFoamy appearance to urineSwelling (edema) of any area of the bodyHigh blood pressure Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Abnormal sounds may be heard when the provider listens to your heart and lungs.Tests that may be done include:ANA titerBUN and creatinineComplement levelsUrinalysisUrine proteinKidney biopsy, to determine appropriate treatmentTreatment

The goal of treatment is to improve kidney function and to delay kidney failure.Medicines may include drugs that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine.You may need dialysis to control symptoms of kidney failure, sometimes for only a while. A kidney transplant may be recommended. People with active lupus should not have a transplant because the condition can occur in the transplanted kidney.Outlook (Prognosis)

How well you do depends on the specific form of lupus nephritis. You may have flare-ups, and then times when you do not have any symptoms. Some people with this condition develop long-term (chronic) kidney failure.Although lupus nephritis may return in a transplanted kidney, it rarely leads to end-stage kidney disease.Possible Complications

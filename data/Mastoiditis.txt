 Mastoiditis is an infection of the mastoid bone of the skull. The mastoid bone is located just behind the ear.Causes

Mastoiditis is most often caused by a middle ear infection (acute otitis media). The infection may spread from the ear to the mastoid bone. The bone has a honeycomb-like structure that fills with infected material and may break down. The condition is most common in children. Before antibiotics, mastoiditis was one of the leading causes of death in children. The condition does not occur very often today. It is also much less dangerous. Symptoms

Symptoms include:Drainage from the earEar pain or discomfortFever, may be high or suddenly increaseHeadacheHearing lossRedness of the ear or behind the earSwelling behind the ear, may cause ear to stick out or feel as if it is filled with fluidExams and Tests

An exam of the head may reveal signs of mastoiditis. The following tests may show an abnormality of the mastoid bone:CT scan of the earHead CT scanA culture of drainage from the ear may show bacteria.Treatment

Mastoiditis may be hard to treat because the medicine may not reach deeply into the bone. The condition sometimes requires repeated or long-term treatment. The infection is treated with antibiotic injections, followed by antibiotics taken by mouth. Surgery to remove part of the bone and drain the mastoid (mastoidectomy) may be needed if antibiotic treatment does not work. Surgery to drain the middle ear through the eardrum (myringotomy) may be needed to treat the middle ear infection.Outlook (Prognosis)

Mastoiditis can be cured. However, it may be hard to treat and may come back.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Destruction of the mastoid boneDizziness or vertigoEpidural abscessFacial paralysisMeningitisPartial or complete hearing lossSpread of infection to the brain or throughout the bodyWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

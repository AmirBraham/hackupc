 Failure to thrive refers to children whose current weight or rate of weight gain is much lower than that of other children of similar age and sex.Causes

Failure to thrive may be caused by medical problems or factors in the child's environment, such as abuse or neglect.There are many medical causes of failure to thrive. These include:Problems with genes, such as Down syndromeOrgan problemsHormone problemsDamage to the brain or central nervous system, which may cause feeding difficulties in an infantHeart or lung problems, which can affect how nutrients move through the bodyAnemia or other blood disordersGastrointestinal problems that make it hard to absorb nutrients or cause a lack of digestive enzymesLong-term (chronic) infectionsMetabolism problemsProblems during pregnancy or low birth weight Factors in the child's environment include:Loss of emotional bond between parent and childPovertyProblems with child-caregiver relationshipParents do not understand the appropriate diet needs for their childExposure to infections, parasites, or toxinsPoor eating habits, such as eating in front of the television and not having formal meal times Many times, the cause cannot be determined.Symptoms

Children who fail to thrive do not grow and develop normally as compared to children of the same age. They seem to be much smaller or shorter. Teenagers may not have the usual changes that occur at puberty.Symptoms of failure to thrive include:Height, weight, and head circumference do not match standard growth chartsWeight is lower than third percentile of standard growth charts or 20% below the ideal weight for their heightGrowth may have slowed or stopped The following may be delayed or slow to develop in children who fail to thrive:Physical skills, such as rolling over, sitting, standing and walkingMental and social skillsSecondary sexual characteristics (delayed in adolescents) Babies who fail to gain weight or develop often lack interest in feeding or have a problem receiving the proper amount of nutrition. This is called poor feeding.Other symptoms that may be seen in a child that fails to thrive include:ConstipationExcessive cryingExcessive sleepiness (lethargy)Irritability Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and check the child's height, weight, and body shape. Parents will be asked about the child's medical and family history.A special test called the Denver Developmental Screening Test may be used to show any delays in development. A growth chart outlining all types of growth since birth is created.The following tests may be done:Complete blood count (CBC)Electrolyte balanceGenetic testingHemoglobin electrophoresis to check for conditions such as sickle cell diseaseHormone tests, including thyroid function testsX-rays to determine bone ageUrinalysisTreatment

Treatment depends on the cause of the delayed growth and development. Delayed growth due to nutritional problems can be helped by showing the parents how to provide a well-balanced diet.Do not give your child dietary supplements such as Boost or Ensure without talking to your provider first.Other treatment depends on how severe the condition is. The following may be recommended:Increase the number of calories and amount of fluid the infant receivesCorrect any vitamin or mineral deficienciesIdentify and treat any other medical conditions The child may need to stay in the hospital for a little while.Treatment may also involve improving the family relationships and living conditions.Outlook (Prognosis)

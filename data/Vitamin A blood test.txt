This test is done to check if you have too much or too little vitamin A in your blood. (These conditions are uncommon in the United States.)Normal Results

Normal values range from 20 to 60 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) or 0.69 to 2.09 micromoles per liter (micromol/L).Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

A lower than normal value means you do not have enough vitamin A in your blood. This may cause:Bones or teeth that do not develop correctlyDry or inflamed eyesFeeling more irritableHair lossLoss of appetiteNight blindnessRecurring infectionsSkin rashesA higher than normal value means you have excess vitamin A in your blood (toxic levels). This may cause:AnemiaBone and muscle painDiarrheaDouble visionHair lossIncreased pressure in the brain (pseudotumor cerebri)Lack of muscle coordination (ataxia)Liver and spleen enlargementLoss of appetiteNauseaVitamin A deficiency may occur if your body has trouble absorbing fats through the digestive tract. This may occur if you have:Chronic lung disease called cystic fibrosisPancreas problems, such as swelling and inflammation (pancreatitis) or the organ not producing enough enzymes (pancreatic insufficiency)Small intestine disorders that reduce nutrient absorption, such as celiac diseaseRisks

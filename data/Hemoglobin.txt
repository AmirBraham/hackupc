 Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The hemoglobin test measures how much hemoglobin is in your blood.How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is necessary.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.Why the Test is Performed

The hemoglobin test is a common test and is almost always done as part of a complete blood count (CBC). Reasons or conditions for ordering the hemoglobin test include:Before and after major surgeryBlood in your stools, or vomit (if you throw up)Chronic medical problems, such as kidney disease or certain types of arthritisDuring pregnancyFatigue, poor health, or unexplained weight lossHeadachesHeavy menstrual periodsLeukemia or other problems in the bone marrowMonitoring during treatment for cancerMonitoring medicines that may cause anemia or low blood countsMonitoring of anemia and its causePoor nutritionProblems concentratingNormal Results

Normal results for adults vary, but in general are:Male: 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 138 to 172 grams per liter (g/L)Female: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL or 121 to 151 g/LNormal results for children vary, but in general are:Newborn: 14 to 24 g/dL or 140 to 240 g/LInfant: 9.5 to 13 g/dL or 95 to 130 g/LThe ranges above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

LOWER THAN NORMAL HEMOGLOBINLow hemoglobin level may be due to:AnemiaBleedingBone marrow being unable to produce new red blood cells. This may be due toÂ leukemia, other cancers, drug toxicity, radiation therapy, infection, or bone marrow disordersChronic illnessChronic kidney diseaseDestruction of red blood cells (hemolysis)LeukemiaMalnutritionToo little iron, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 in the dietToo much water in the bodyHIGHER THAN NORMAL HEMOGLOBINHigh hemoglobin level is most often caused by low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia), present over a long period of time. Common reasons include:Bone marrow disease that causes abnormal increase in red blood cells (polycythemia vera)Congenital heart diseaseExposure to high altitudeFailure of the right side of the heartLow levels of oxygen in the bloodScarring or thickening of the lungsToo little water in the body (dehydration)Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:Excessive bleedingFainting or feeling lightheadedMultiple punctures to locate veinsHematoma (blood buildup under the skin)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names

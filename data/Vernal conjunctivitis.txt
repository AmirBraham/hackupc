 Vernal conjunctivitis is long-term (chronic) swelling (inflammation) of the outer lining of the eyes. It is due to an allergic reaction.Causes

Vernal conjunctivitis often occurs in people with a strong family history of allergies. These may include allergic rhinitis, asthma, and eczema. It is most common in young males, and most often occurs during the spring and summer.Symptoms

Treatment may include:Antihistamine or anti-inflammatory drops that are placed into the eyeEye drops that prevent a type of white blood cell called mast cells from releasing histamine (may help prevent future attacks)Mild steroids that are applied directly to the surface of the eye (for severe reactions)Cyclosporine 0.1% eye drops contain a mild form of the immune-suppressing medicine and may help treat acute episodes of vernal conjunctivitis. They may also help prevent recurrences.Outlook (Prognosis)

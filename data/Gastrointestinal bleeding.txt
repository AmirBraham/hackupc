 Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding refers to any bleeding that starts in the gastrointestinal tract.Bleeding may come from any site along the GI tract, but is often divided into:Upper GI bleeding: The upper GI tract includes the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach), stomach, and first part of the small intestine (duodenum).Lower GI bleeding: The lower GI tract includes most of the small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.Considerations

The amount of GI bleeding may be so small that it can only be detected on a lab test, such as the fecal occult blood test. Other signs of GI bleeding include:Dark, tarry stoolsLarger amounts of blood passed from the rectum
 Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl, on toilet paper, or in streaks on stool (feces)Vomiting blood Massive bleeding from the GI tract can be dangerous. However, even very small amounts of bleeding that occur over a long period of time can lead to problems such as anemia or low blood counts.Once a bleeding site is found, many therapies are available to stop the bleeding or treat the cause.Causes

These may include cancers of the GI tract, such as:Cancer of the colonCancer of the small intestineCancer of the stomachIntestinal polyps (a pre-cancerous condition)Other causes of GI bleeding may include:Abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the intestines (also called angiodysplasia)Bleeding diverticulum, or diverticulosisCrohn disease or ulcerative colitisEsophageal varicesEsophagitisGastric (stomach) ulcerIntussusception (bowel telescoped on itself)Mallory-Weiss tearMeckel diverticulumRadiation injury to the bowel Home Care

 Lung metastases are cancerous tumors that start somewhere else in the body and spread to the lungs.Causes

Metastatic tumors in the lungs are cancers that developed at other places in the body (or other parts of the lungs). They then spread through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to the lungs. It is different than lung cancer that starts in the lungs. Nearly any cancer can spread to the lungs. Common cancers include:Bladder cancerBreast cancerLung cancerColorectal cancerKidney cancerMelanomaOvarian cancerSarcomaThyroid cancerPancreatic cancerTesticular cancer Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Bloody sputumChest painCoughShortness of breathWeaknessWeight lossExams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms. Tests that may be done include:Bronchoscopy to view the airwaysChest CT scanChest x-rayCytologic studies of pleural fluid or sputumLung needle biopsyPET scanSurgery to take a sample of tissue from the lungs (surgical lung biopsy) Treatment

Chemotherapy is often used to treat metastatic cancer to the lung. Surgery to remove the tumors may be done when any of the following occurs:The cancer has spread to only limited areas of the lungThe lung tumors can be completely removed with surgery However, the main tumor must be curable, and the person must be strong enough to go through the surgery and recovery.Other treatments include:Radiation therapyImmunotherapyTargeted systemic therapyThe placement of stents inside the airwaysLaser therapyUsing local heat probes to destroy the areaUsing very cold temperature to destroy the areaSupport Groups

You can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group where members share common experiences and problems.Outlook (Prognosis)

A cure is unlikely in most cases of cancers that have spread to the lungs. But the outlook depends on the main cancer. In some cases, a person can live more than 5 years with metastatic cancer to the lungs.Possible Complications

Complications of metastatic tumors in the lungs may include:Fluid between the lung and chest wall (pleural effusion), which can cause shortness of breath or pain when taking a deep breathFurther spread of the cancerWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you have a history of cancer and you develop:
   Coughing up blood
   
   Persistent cough

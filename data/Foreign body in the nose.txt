 This article discusses first aid for a foreign object placed into the nose.Considerations

Curious young children may insert small objects into their nose in a normal attempt to explore their own bodies. Objects placed in the nose may include food, seeds, dried beans, small toys (such as marbles), crayon pieces, erasers, paper wads, cotton, beads, button batteries, and disc magnets.A foreign body in a child's nose can be there for a while without a parent being aware of the problem. The object may only be discovered when visiting your health care provider to find the cause of irritation, bleeding, infection, or difficulty breathing.Symptoms

Symptoms that your child may have a foreign body in his or her nose include: Difficulty breathing through the affected nostrilFeeling of something in the noseFoul-smelling or bloody nasal dischargeIrritability, particularly in infantsIrritation or pain in the nose First Aid

First aid steps include:Have the person breathe through the mouth. The person should not breathe in sharply. This may force the object in further. Gently press and close the nostril that does not have the object in it. Ask the person to blow gently. This may help push the object out. Avoid blowing the nose too hard or repeatedly. If this method fails, get medical help. DO NOT

Do not search the nose with cotton swabs or other tools. This may push the object further into the nose.Do not use tweezers or other tools to remove an object that is stuck deep inside the nose.Do not try to remove an object that you cannot see or one that is not easy to grasp. This can push the object farther in or cause damage.When to Contact a Medical Professional

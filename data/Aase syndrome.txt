 Aase syndrome is a rare disorder that involves anemia and certain joint and skeletal deformities.Causes

Many cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins).This condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.The anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Absent or small knucklesCleft palateDeformed earsDroopy eyelidsInability to fully extend the joints from birthNarrow shouldersPale skinTriple-jointed thumbsExams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include:Bone marrow biopsyComplete blood count (CBC)EchocardiogramX-raysTreatment

Treatment may involve blood transfusions in the first year of life to treat anemia. A steroid medicine called prednisone has also been used to treat anemia associated with Aase syndrome. However, it should only be used after reviewing the benefits and risks with a provider who has experience treating anemias.A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if other treatment fails.Outlook (Prognosis)

The anemia tends to improve with age.Possible Complications

Complications related to anemia include:FatigueDecreased oxygen in the bloodWeakness Heart problems can lead to a variety of complications, depending on the specific defect.Severe cases of Aase syndrome have been associated with stillbirth or early death.Prevention

Genetic counseling is recommended if you have a family history of this syndrome and wish to become pregnant.Alternative Names

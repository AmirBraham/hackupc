 Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is a condition that causes a decreased ability to move and feel (sensation) because of nerve damage.Causes

Neuropathy means a disease of, or damage to nerves. When it occurs outside of the central nervous system (CNS), that is, the brain and spinal cord, it is called a peripheral neuropathy. Mononeuropathy means one nerve is involved. Polyneuropathy means that many nerves in different parts of the body are involved.Neuropathy can affect nerves that provide feeling (sensory neuropathy) or cause movement (motor neuropathy). It can also affect both, in which case it is called a sensorimotor neuropathy.Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is a bodywide (systemic) process that damages nerve cells, nerve fibers (axons), and nerve coverings (myelin sheath). Damage to the covering of the nerve cell causes nerve signals to slow or stop. Damage to the nerve fiber or entire nerve cell can make the nerve stop working. Some neuropathies develop over years, while others can start and get severe within hours to days.Nerve damage can be caused by:Autoimmune (when the body attacks itself) disordersConditions that put pressure on nervesDecreased blood flow to the nerveDiseases that destroy the glue (connective tissue) that holds cells and tissues togetherSwelling (inflammation) of the nervesSome diseases lead to polyneuropathy that is mainly sensory or mainly motor. Possible causes of sensorimotor polyneuropathy include:Alcoholic neuropathyAmyloid polyneuropathyAutoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren syndromeCancer (called a paraneoplastic neuropathy)Long-term (chronic) inflammatory neuropathyDiabetic neuropathyDrug-related neuropathy, including chemotherapyGuillain-Barré syndromeHereditary neuropathyHIV/AIDSLow thyroidParkinson diseaseVitamin deficiency (vitamins B12, B1, and E)Zika virus infectionSymptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Decreased feeling in any area of the bodyDifficulty swallowing or breathingDifficulty using the arms or handsDifficulty using the legs or feetDifficulty walkingPain, burning, tingling, or abnormal feeling in any area of the body (called neuralgia)Weakness of the face, arms, or legs, or any area of the body Occasional falls due to lack of balance and not feeling the ground under your feetSymptoms may develop quickly (as in Guillain-Barré syndrome) or slowly over weeks to years. Symptoms usually occur on both sides of the body. Most often, they start at the ends of the toes first.Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. An exam may show:Decreased feeling (may affect touch, pain, vibration, or position sensation)Diminished reflexes (most commonly the ankle)Muscle atrophyMuscle twitchesMuscle weaknessParalysisTests may include:Biopsy of the affected nervesBlood testsElectrical test of the muscles (EMG)Electrical test of nerve conductionX-rays or other imaging tests, such as MRIGenetic testingSpinal fluid testing (lumbar puncture/spinal tap)Treatment

Goals of treatment include:Finding the causeControlling the symptomsPromoting a person's self-care and independenceDepending on the cause, treatment may include:Changing medicines, if they are causing the problemControlling blood sugar level, when the neuropathy is from diabetesNot drinking alcoholTaking daily nutritional supplementsMedicines to treat the underlying cause of the polyneuropathyPROMOTING SELF-CARE AND INDEPENDENCEExercises and retraining to maximize function of the damaged nervesJob (vocational) therapyOccupational therapyOrthopedic treatmentsPhysical therapyWheelchairs, braces, or splintsCONTROL OF SYMPTOMSSafety is important for people with neuropathy. Lack of muscle control and decreased sensation can increase the risk of falls or other injuries.If you have movement difficulties, these measures can help keep you safe:Leave lights on.Remove obstacles (such as loose rugs that may slip on the floor).Test water temperature before bathing.Use railings.Wear protective shoes (such as those with closed toes and low heels).Wear shoes that have non-slippery soles.Have a therapist assess your need for an assistive device such as a cane or walker.Other tips include:Check your feet (or other affected area) daily for bruises, open skin areas, or other injuries,which you may not notice that can become infected.Check the inside of shoes often for grit or rough spots that may injure your feet.Visit a foot doctor (podiatrist) to assess and reduce the risk of injury to your feet.Avoid leaning on your elbows, crossing your knees, or being in other positions that put prolonged pressure on certain body areas.Medicines used to treat the symptoms of this condition:Over-the-counter and prescription pain relievers to reduce stabbing pain (neuralgia)Anticonvulsants or antidepressantsLotions, creams, or medicated patchesOther treatments may be directed against your immune system to stop an autoimmune attack:Steroids and other immunosuppressantsPlasma pheresis (plasma exchange)Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)Use pain medicine only when necessary. Keeping your body in the proper position or keeping bed linens off a tender body part may help control pain.Support Groups

In some cases, you can fully recover from peripheral neuropathy if your provider can find the cause and successfully treat it, and if the damage does not affect the entire nerve cell.The amount of disability varies. Some people have no disability. Others have partial or complete loss of movement, function, or feeling. Nerve pain may be uncomfortable and may last for a long time.In some cases, sensorimotor polyneuropathy causes severe, life-threatening symptoms.Possible Complications

Problems that may result include:DeformityInjury to feet (caused by bad shoes or hot water when stepping into the bathtub)NumbnessPainTrouble walkingWeaknessDifficulty breathing or swallowing (in severe cases)Falls due to lack of balanceWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have loss of movement or feeling in a part of your body. Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chance of controlling the symptoms.Alternative Names

 Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver and poor liver function. It is the last stage of chronic liver disease.Causes

Cirrhosis is most often the end result of chronic liver damage caused by long-term (chronic) liver disease. Common causes of chronic liver disease in the United States are:Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.Alcohol overuse.Buildup of fat in the liver that is NOT caused by drinking too much alcohol (called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]). It is closely related to being overweight, having high blood pressure, diabetes or pre-diabetes, and high cholesterol. Less common causes of cirrhosis include:When immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them, called autoimmune hepatitis (AH)Bile duct disordersSome medicinesLiver diseases passed down in familiesSymptoms

There may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly, depending on how well the liver is working. Often, it is discovered by chance when an abdominal ultrasound exam is done or blood is drawn for another reason.Early symptoms include: Fatigue and loss of energyPoor appetite and weight lossNausea or belly painSmall, red spider-like blood vessels on the skin As liver function worsens, symptoms may include: Fluid buildup in the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites)Yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes (jaundice)Redness on the palms of the handsIn men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swellingEasy bruising and abnormal bleeding, most often from swollen veins in the digestive tractConfusion or problems thinkingPale or clay-colored stoolsBleeding from upper or lower gastrointestinal tractExams and Tests

Your health care provider will do a physical exam to look for:An enlarged liver or spleenExcess breast tissue (in men)Swollen abdomen, as a result of too much fluidReddened palmsRed spider-like blood vessels on the skinSmall testicles (in men)Widened veins in the abdomen wallYellow eyes or skin (jaundice) You may have the following tests to determine the cause of your cirrhosis:Hepatitis virus testingAntibody testing for autoimmune hepatitisSerum iron saturation and ferritin levelsSerum ceruloplasmin levelGenetic testing for liver disordersYou may have the following tests to measure liver function:Complete blood countProthrombin timeLiver function testsBlood albumin level Other tests to check for liver damage include:Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomenMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomenEndoscopy to check for abnormal veins in the esophagus or stomachUltrasound of the abdomenYou might need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.Treatment

LIFESTYLE CHANGESSome things you can do to help take care of your liver disease are: Drink no alcohol.Eat a healthy diet that is low in salt, fat, and simple carbohydrates.Get vaccinated for diseases such as influenza, COVID-19, hepatitis A and B, and pneumococcal disease.Talk to your provider about all medicines you take, including herbs and supplements and over-the-counter medicines.Exercise.Control your underlying metabolic problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.MEDICINES FROM YOUR PROVIDERWater pills (diuretics) to get rid of fluid build-upVitamin K or blood products to prevent excess bleedingMedicines for mental confusionAntibiotics for infections OTHER TREATMENTSEndoscopic treatments for enlarged veins in the esophagus (varices)Removal of fluid from the abdomen (paracentesis)Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to improve blood flow in the liver When cirrhosis progresses to end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be needed. Support Groups

You can often ease the stress of illness by joining a liver disease support group whose members share common experiences and problems.Outlook (Prognosis)

Cirrhosis is caused by scarring of the liver. In most cases, the liver cannot heal or return to normal function once the damage is severe. Cirrhosis can lead to serious complications. Possible Complications

Complications may include:Bleeding disordersBuildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and infection of the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)Enlarged veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines that bleed easily (varices)Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension)Kidney failure (hepatorenal syndrome)Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)Mental confusion, change in the level of consciousness, or coma (hepatic encephalopathy) When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of cirrhosis.Get emergency medical help right away if you have:Abdominal or chest painAbdominal swelling or ascites that is new or suddenly becomes worseA fever (temperature greater than 101°F or 38.3°C)DiarrheaConfusion or a change in alertness, or it gets worseRectal bleeding, vomiting blood, or blood in the urineShortness of breathVomiting more than once a dayYellowing skin or eyes (jaundice) that is new or gets worse quickly Prevention

DO NOT drink alcohol. Talk to your provider if you are worried about your drinking. Take steps to prevent getting hepatitis B or C or passing it to other people.Alternative Names

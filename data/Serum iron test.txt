Your provider may recommend this test if you have:Signs of low iron (iron deficiency)Signs of too much ironAnemia caused by a chronic diseaseNormal Results

Normal value range is:Iron: 60 to 170 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL), or 10.74 to 30.43 micromoles per liter (micromol/L)Total iron binding capacity (TIBC): 240 to 450 mcg/dL, or 42.96 to 80.55 micromol/LTransferrin saturation: 20% to 50%The numbers above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Higher-than-normal iron level may be a sign of:Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis)Anemia due to red blood cells being destroyed too quickly (hemolytic anemia)Liver tissue deathInflammation of the liver (hepatitis)Iron poisoningFrequent blood transfusionsLower-than-normal level may be a sign of:Long-term digestive tract bleedingHeavy menstrual bleedingIntestinal conditions that cause poor absorption of ironNot enough iron in the dietPregnancyRisks

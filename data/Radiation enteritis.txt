 Radiation enteritis is damage to the lining of the intestines (bowels) caused by radiation therapy, which is used for some types of cancer treatment.Causes

Radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. The therapy may also damage healthy cells in the lining of the intestines.People who have radiation therapy to the belly or pelvic area are at risk. These may include people with cervical, pancreatic, prostate, uterine, or colon or rectal cancer.Symptoms

Symptoms may vary, depending on which part of the intestines received the radiation. Symptoms can be worse if:You have chemotherapy at the same time as the radiation.You receive stronger doses of radiation.A larger area of your intestines receives radiation.Symptoms may occur during or shortly after or long after radiation treatment.Changes in bowel movements may include:Bleeding or mucus from the rectumDiarrhea or watery stoolsFeeling the need to have a bowel movement most or all of the timePain in the rectal area, especially during bowel movements Other symptoms can include:Loss of appetiteNausea and vomiting Most of the time, these symptoms get better within 2 to 3 months after radiation treatment ends. However, the condition may occur months or years after radiation therapy.When symptoms become long-term (chronic), other problems may include:Abdominal painBloody diarrheaGreasy or fatty stoolsWeight loss Exams and Tests

The health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history.Tests may include:Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopyUpper endoscopyTreatment

Starting a low-fiber diet on the first day of radiation treatment may help you avoid problems. The best choice of foods depends on your symptoms. Some things can make symptoms worse, and should be avoided. These include: Alcohol and tobaccoAlmost all milk productsCoffee, tea, chocolate, and sodas with caffeineFoods containing whole branFresh and dried fruitsFried, greasy, or fatty foodsNuts and seedsPopcorn, potato chips, and pretzelsRaw vegetablesRich pastries and baked goodsSome fruit juicesStrong spices Foods and drinks that are better choices include:Apple or grape juiceApplesauce, peeled apples, and bananasEggs, buttermilk, and yogurtFish, poultry, and meat that has been broiled or roastedMild, cooked vegetables, such as asparagus tips, green or black beans, carrots, spinach, and squashPotatoes that have been baked, boiled, or mashedProcessed cheeses, such as American cheeseSmooth peanut butterWhite bread, macaroni, or noodles Your provider may have you use certain medicines such as:Drugs that help decrease diarrhea, such as loperamidePain medicinesSteroid foam that coats the lining of the rectumSpecial enzymes to replace enzymes from the pancreasOral 5-aminosalicylates or metronidazoleRectal installation with hydrocortisone, sucralfate, 5-aminosalicylatesOther things you can do include:Eat foods at room temperature.Eat small meals more often.Drink plenty of fluids, up to 12 8-ounce (240 milliliter) glasses every day when you have diarrhea. Some people will need fluids given through a vein (intravenous fluids).Your provider may choose to decrease your radiation for a short period of time.There often are no good treatments for chronic radiation enteritis that is more severe.Medicines such as cholestyramine, diphenoxylate-atropine, loperamide, or sucralfate may help.Thermal therapy (argon laser probe, plasma coagulation, heater probe).You may need to consider surgery to either remove or go around (bypass) a section of damaged intestine.Outlook (Prognosis)

When the abdomen receives radiation, there is always some nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In most cases, the symptoms get better within 2 to 3 months after treatment ends.However, when this condition develops, symptoms may last for a long period of time. Long-term (chronic) enteritis is rarely curable.Possible Complications

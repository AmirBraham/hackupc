 Normally, the amount of urine your body produces decreases at night. This allows most people to sleep 6 to 8 hours without having to urinate.Some people wake up from sleep more often to urinate during the night. This can disrupt sleep cycles.Causes

Drinking too much fluid during the evening can cause you to urinate more often during the night. Caffeine and alcohol with or after dinner can also lead to this problem. Other common causes of urination at night include:Infection of the bladder or urinary tractDrinking a lot of alcohol, caffeine, or other fluids before bedtimeEnlarged prostate gland (benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH)Pregnancy Other conditions that can lead to the problem include:Chronic kidney failureDiabetesDrinking excessive amount of waterHeart failureHigh blood calcium levelCertain medicines, including water pills (diuretics)Diabetes insipidusSwelling of the legsWaking often during the night to urinate can also be linked to obstructive sleep apnea and other sleeping disorders. Nocturia may go away when the sleeping problem is under control. Stress and restlessness can also cause you to wake up at night.Home Care

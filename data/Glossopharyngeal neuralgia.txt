 Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a rare condition in which there are repeated episodes of severe pain in the tongue, throat, ear, and tonsils. This can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.Causes

Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is believed to be caused by irritation of the ninth cranial nerve, called the glossopharyngeal nerve. Symptoms usually begin in people over age 50.In most cases, the source of irritation is never found. Possible causes for this type of nerve pain (neuralgia) are:Blood vessels pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerveGrowths at the base of the skull pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerveTumors or infections of the throat and mouth pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerveSymptoms

The pain usually occurs on one side and may be jabbing. In rare cases, both sides are involved. Symptoms include severe pain in areas connected to the ninth cranial nerve:Back of the nose and throat (nasopharynx)Back of the tongueEarThroatTonsil areaVoice box (larynx)The pain occurs in episodes and may be severe. The episodes can occur many times each day and awaken the person from sleep. It can sometimes be triggered by:ChewingCoughingLaughingSpeakingSwallowingYawningSneezingCold beveragesTouching (a blunt object to the tonsil of the affected side)Exams and Tests

Tests will be done to identify problems, such as tumors, at the base of the skull. Tests may include:Blood tests to rule out any infection or tumorCT scan of the headMRI of the headX-rays of the head or neck Sometimes the MRI may show swelling (inflammation) of the glossopharyngeal nerve.To find out whether a blood vessel is pressing on the nerve, pictures of the brain arteries may be taken using:Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)CT angiogramX-rays of the arteries with a dye (conventional angiography) Treatment

The goal of treatment is to control pain. The most effective drugs are antiseizure medicines such as carbamazepine. Antidepressants may help certain people.In severe cases, when pain is difficult to treat, surgery to take pressure off the glossopharyngeal nerve may be needed. This is called microvascular decompression. The nerve can also be cut (rhizotomy). Both surgeries are effective. If a cause of the neuralgia is found, treatment should control the underlying problem.Outlook (Prognosis)

How well you do depends on the cause of the problem and the effectiveness of the first treatment. Surgery is considered effective for people who do not benefit from medicines.Possible Complications

Complications of GPN may include:Slow pulse and fainting may occur when pain is severeDamage to the carotid artery or internal jugular artery due to injuries, such as a stab wound, that may be associated with GPNDifficulty in swallowing food and speakingSide effects of the medicines usedWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

See your health care provider right away if you have symptoms of GPN. See a pain specialist if the pain is severe, to be sure that you are aware of all your options for controlling pain.Alternative Names

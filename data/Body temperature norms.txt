 Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6°F (37°C). Some studies have shown that the "normal" body temperature can have a wide range, from 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).A temperature over 100.4°F (38°C) most often means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness.Body temperature normally changes throughout the day and in adults, it is lowest in the early morning.Alternative Names

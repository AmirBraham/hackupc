 Hypothalamic dysfunction is a problem with part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus helps control the pituitary gland and regulates many body functions.Causes

The hypothalamus helps keep the body's internal functions in balance. It helps regulate:Appetite and weightBody temperatureChildbirthEmotions, behavior, memoryGrowthProduction of breast milkSalt and water balanceSex driveSleep-wake cycle and the body clock Another important function of the hypothalamus is to control the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It lies just below the hypothalamus. The pituitary, in turn, controls the:Adrenal glandsOvariesTestesThyroid gland There are many causes of hypothalamic dysfunction. The most common are:Surgery Brain injuryBrain tumorsRadiation treatment to the brainOther causes include: Nutrition problems, such as eating disorders (anorexia), extreme weight lossBlood vessel problems in the brain, such as aneurysm, pituitary apoplexy,Â subarachnoid hemorrhageGenetic disorders, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, familial diabetes insipidus, Kallmann syndromeInfections and swelling (inflammation) due to certain immune system diseases Symptoms

Symptoms are usually due to the hormones or brain signals that are missing. In children, there may be growth problems, either too much or too little growth. In other children, puberty occurs too early or too late.Tumor symptoms may include headache or loss of vision.If the thyroid is affected, there may be symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). Symptoms may include feeling cold all the time, constipation, fatigue, or weight gain, among others.If the adrenal glands are affected, there may be symptoms of low adrenal function. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, weight loss, and lack of interest in activities.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.Blood or urine tests may be ordered to determine levels of hormones such as:CortisolEstrogenGrowth hormonePituitary hormonesProlactinTestosteroneThyroidSodiumBlood and urine osmolalityOther possible tests include:Hormone injections followed by timed blood samplesMRI or CT scans of the brainVisual field eye exam (if there is a tumor)Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause of the hypothalamic dysfunction:For tumors, surgery or radiation may be needed.For hormonal deficiencies, missing hormones need to be replaced by taking medicine. This is effective for pituitary problems and for salt and water balance.Medicines are usually not effective for changes in temperature or sleep regulation.Some medicines may help with problems related to appetite regulation and weight gain.Outlook (Prognosis)

Many causes of hypothalamic dysfunction are treatable or reversible. Most of the time, missing hormones can be replaced.Possible Complications

Complications of hypothalamic dysfunction depend on the cause.BRAIN TUMORSPermanent blindnessProblems related to the brain area where the tumor occursVision disordersProblems controlling salt and water balanceHYPOTHYROIDISMHeart problemsHigh cholesterolADRENAL INSUFFICIENCYInability to deal with stress (such as surgery or infection), which can be life threatening by causing low blood pressureSEX GLAND DEFICIENCYHeart diseaseErection problemsInfertilityThin bones (osteoporosis)Problems breast feedingProblems with uterine contractions during deliveryGROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCYHigh cholesterolOsteoporosisShort stature (in children)WeaknessWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have:HeadachesSymptoms of hormone excess or deficiencyVision problems Prevention

If you have symptoms of a hormonal deficiency, discuss replacement therapy with your provider.Alternative Names

 Lactic acidosis refers to lactic acid build up in the bloodstream. Lactic acid is produced when oxygen levels become low in cells within the areas of the body where metabolism takes place or in response to sympathetic overactivity related to epinephrine-type substances or exercise.Causes

The most common cause of lactic acidosis is severe medical illness in which blood pressure is low and too little oxygen is reaching the body's tissues. Intense exercise or convulsions can cause temporary lactic acidosis. Certain diseases can also cause the condition, including: AIDSAlcoholismCancerCirrhosisCyanide poisoningKidney failureRespiratory failureSepsis (severe infection)Some medicines can rarely cause lactic acidosis:Beta adrenergic agonist inhalers used to treat asthma or COPD (albuterol and salmeterol)EpinephrineLinezolidMetformin, used to treat diabetes (most often when overdosed)Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used to treat HIV infectionPropofolSymptoms

Symptoms may include:NauseaVomitingWeakness Exams and Tests

Tests may include a blood test to check lactate and electrolyte levels.Treatment

The main treatment for lactic acidosis is to correct the medical problem that causes the condition.References

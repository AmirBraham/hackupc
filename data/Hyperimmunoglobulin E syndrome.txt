 Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is a rare, genetic disease. It causes problems with the skin, sinuses, lungs, bones, and teeth.Causes

Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is also called Job syndrome. It is named after the biblical character Job, whose faithfulness was tested by an affliction with draining skin sores and pustules. People with this condition have long-term, severe skin infections.The symptoms are most often present in childhood, but because the disease is so rare, it often takes years before a correct diagnosis is made.Recent research suggests that the disease is often caused by a genetic change that takes place in the STAT3gene on chromosome 17. How this gene abnormality causes the symptoms of the disease is not well understood. However, people with the disease have a higher-than-normal level of a type of antibody called IgE.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Bone and tooth defects, including fractures and losing the baby teeth lateEczemaSkin abscesses and infectionRepeated sinus infectionsRepeated lung infections
   Exams and Tests

A physical exam may show:Curving of the spine (kyphoscoliosis)OsteomyelitisRepeat sinus infectionsTests used to confirm the diagnosis include:Absolute eosinophil countCBC with blood differentialSerum globulin electrophoresis to look for high blood IgE levelGenetic testing of STAT3 geneAn eye exam may reveal signs of dry eye syndrome.A chest x-ray may reveal lung abscesses.Other tests that may be done:CT scan of the chest
   Cultures of the infected siteSpecial blood tests to check parts of the immune systemX-ray of the bones
   CT scan of the sinuses
   A scoring system that combines the different problems of Hyper IgE syndrome may be used to help make the diagnosis.Treatment

There is no known cure for this condition. The goal of treatment is to control the infections. Medicines include:AntibioticsAntifungal and antiviral medicines (when appropriate)Surgery is sometimes needed to drain abscesses.Gamma globulin given through a vein (IV) may help build up the immune system if you have severe infections.Outlook (Prognosis)

Hyper IgE syndrome is a lifelong chronic condition. Each new infection requires treatment.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Repeated infectionsSepsisWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of Hyper IgE syndrome.Prevention

There is no proven way to prevent Hyper IgE syndrome. Good general hygiene is helpful in preventing skin infections.Some providers may recommend preventive antibiotics for people who develop many infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus. This treatment does not change the condition, but it can lessen its complications.Alternative Names

Job syndrome; Hyper IgE syndromeReferences

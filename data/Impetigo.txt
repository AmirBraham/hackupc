 Impetigo is a common skin infection.Causes

Impetigo is caused by streptococcus (strep) or staphylococcus (staph) bacteria. Methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA) is an increasing cause.Skin typically has many types of bacteria on it. When there is a break in the skin, bacteria can enter the body and grow there. This causes inflammation and infection. Breaks in the skin may occur from injury or trauma to the skin or from insect, animal, or human bites.Impetigo may also occur on the skin, where there is no visible break.Impetigo is most common in children who live in unhealthy conditions.In adults, it may occur following another skin problem. It may also develop after a cold or other virus. Impetigo can spread to others. You can catch the infection from someone who has it if the fluid that oozes from their skin blisters touches an open area on your skin.Symptoms

Symptoms of impetigo are:One or many blisters that are filled with pus and easy to pop. In infants, the skin is reddish or raw-looking where a blister has broken.Blisters that itch are filled with yellow or honey-colored fluid and ooze and crust over. Rash that may begin as a single spot but spreads to other areas due to scratching.Skin sores on the face, lips, arms, or legs that spread to other areas.Swollen lymph nodes near the infection.Patches of impetigo on the body (in children).

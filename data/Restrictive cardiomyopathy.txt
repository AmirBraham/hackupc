 Restrictive cardiomyopathy refers to a set of changes in how the heart muscle functions. These changes cause the heart to fill poorly (more common) or squeeze poorly (less common). Sometimes, both problems are present. Causes

In a case of restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is of normal size or slightly enlarged. Most of the time, it also pumps normally. However, it does not relax normally during the time between heartbeats when the blood returns from the body (diastole).Although the main problem is abnormal filling of the heart, the heart may not pump blood strongly when the disease progresses. The abnormal heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may affect either or both of the lower heart chambers (ventricles). Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The most common causes are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. It also can occur after a heart transplant.Other causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy include:Cardiac amyloidosisCarcinoid heart diseaseDiseases of the heart lining (endocardium), such as endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler syndrome (rare)Iron overload (hemochromatosis)SarcoidosisScarring after radiation or chemotherapySclerodermaTumors of the heart Symptoms

Symptoms of heart failure are most common. These symptoms often develop slowly over time. However, symptoms sometimes start very suddenly and are severe.Common symptoms are:CoughBreathing problems that occur at night, with activity or when lying flat 
  Fatigue and inability to exerciseLoss of appetite
  Swelling of the abdomen
  
  Swelling of the feet and anklesUneven or rapid pulse Other symptoms may include:Chest painInability to concentrateLow urine outputNeed to urinate at night (in adults) Exams and Tests

A physical exam may show:Enlarged (distended) or bulging neck veinsEnlarged liverLung crackles and abnormal or distant heart sounds in the chest heard through a stethoscopeFluid backup into the hands and feetSigns of heart failureTests for restrictive cardiomyopathy include:Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiographyChest CT scanChest x-rayECG (electrocardiogram)Echocardiogram and Doppler studyMRI of the heartNuclear heart scan (MUGA, RNV, PET)Serum iron studiesSerum and urine protein tests Restrictive cardiomyopathy may appear similar to constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac catheterization may help confirm the diagnosis. Rarely, a biopsy of the heart may be required.Treatment

The condition causing the cardiomyopathy is treated when it can be found. Few treatments are known to work well for restrictive cardiomyopathy. The main goal of treatment is to control symptoms and improve quality of life.The following treatments may be used to control symptoms or prevent problems:Blood thinning medicinesChemotherapy (in some situations)Diuretics to remove fluid and help improve breathingMedicines to prevent or control abnormal heart rhythmsOther treatments that may be used depending on the specific type of cardiomyopathy include:Chemotherapeutic agentsMedicines such as tafamidis that target abnormal proteins (amyloid fibrils) Liver transplantation Additional treatments are also under investigation.A heart transplant may be considered if the heart function is very poor and symptoms are severe. Outlook (Prognosis)

People with this condition often develop heart failure that gets worse. Problems with heart rhythm or "leaky" heart valves may also occur.People with restrictive cardiomyopathy may be heart transplant candidates. The outlook depends on the cause of the condition, but it is usually poor. Survival after diagnosis may exceed 10 years.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy.Alternative Names

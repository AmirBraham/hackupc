 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing cancer of a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes. ALL occurs when the bone marrow produces a large number of immature lymphoblasts, a cancerous form of lymphocytes. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. The abnormal lymphoblasts grow quickly and replace normal cells in the bone marrow. ALL prevents healthy blood cells from being made. Life-threatening symptoms can occur as normal blood counts drop.Causes

Most of the time, no clear cause can be found for ALL. The following factors may play a role in the development of all types of leukemia:Certain chromosome problemsExposure to radiationPast treatment with chemotherapy drugsReceiving a bone marrow transplantToxins, such as benzene The following factors are known to increase the risk for ALL:Down syndrome or other genetic disordersA brother or sister with leukemia This type of leukemia usually affects children ages 3 to 7. ALL is the most common childhood cancer, but it can also occur in adults.Symptoms

ALL makes a person more likely to bleed and develop infections. Symptoms include:Bone and joint painEasy bruising and bleeding (such as bleeding gums, skin bleeding, nosebleeds, abnormal periods)Feeling weak or tiredFeverLoss of appetite and weight lossPalenessPain or feeling of fullness below the ribs from an enlarged liver or spleenPinpoint red spots on the skin (petechiae)Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under arms, and groinNight sweats These symptoms can occur with other conditions. Talk to a health care provider about the meaning of specific symptoms.Exams and Tests

The provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Blood tests may include:Complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) countPlatelet countBone marrow biopsyLumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for leukemia cells in the spinal fluid Tests are also done to look for changes in the DNA inside the abnormal white cells. Certain DNA changes may determine how well a person does (prognosis), and what kind of treatment is recommended.Treatment

The first goal of treatment is to get blood counts back to normal. If this occurs and the bone marrow looks healthy under the microscope, the cancer is said to be in remission. Chemotherapy is the first treatment tried with the goal of achieving a remission.The person may need to stay in the hospital for chemotherapy. Or it can be given at a clinic and the person goes home afterward.Chemotherapy is given into the veins (by IV) and sometimes into the fluid around the brain (the spinal fluid). Oral chemotherapy may be given after a remission to maintain it.After a remission is achieved, more treatment is given to achieve a cure. This treatment can include more IV chemotherapy or radiation to the brain. Stem cell or bone marrow transplant from another person may also be done. Further treatment depends on:Age and health of the personGenetic changes in the leukemia cellsHow many courses of chemotherapy it took to achieve remissionIf abnormal cell DNA is detected in the bone marrow after remissionAvailability of donors for stem cell transplant You and your provider may need to manage other concerns during your leukemia treatment, including:Having chemotherapy at homeManaging your pets during chemotherapyBleeding problemsDry mouthEating enough caloriesSafe eating during cancer treatment Support Groups

You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.Outlook (Prognosis)

Those who respond to treatment right away tend to do better. Most children with ALL can be cured. Children often have a better outcome than adults.Possible Complications

Both leukemia itself and the treatment can lead to many problems such as bleeding, weight loss, and infections.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you or your child develops symptoms of ALL.Prevention

The risk for developing ALL may be reduced by avoiding contact with certain toxins, radiation, and chemicals.Alternative Names

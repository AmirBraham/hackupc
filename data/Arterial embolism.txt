 Arterial embolism refers to a clot (embolus) that has come from another part of the body and causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part.Causes

An "embolus" is a blood clot or a piece of plaque that acts like a clot. The word "emboli" means there is more than one clot or piece of plaque. When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism.An arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots. The clots can get stuck in an artery and block blood flow. The blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death (necrosis).Arterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Emboli that occur in the brain cause a stroke. Ones that occur in the heart cause a heart attack. Less common sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes.Risk factors for arterial embolism include:Abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillationInjury or damage to an artery wallConditions that increase blood clotting Another condition that poses a high risk for embolization (especially to the brain) is mitral stenosis. Endocarditis (infection of the inside of the heart) can also cause arterial emboli.A common source for an embolus is from areas of hardening (atherosclerosis causing plaque) in the aorta and other large blood vessels. These clots can break loose and flow down to the legs and feet.Paradoxical embolization can take place when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side of the heart. The clot can then move to an artery and block blood flow to the brain (stroke) or other organs.If a clot travels and lodges in the arteries supplying blood flow to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus.Symptoms

You may not have any symptoms. Symptoms may begin quickly or slowly depending on the size of the embolus and how much it blocks the blood flow.Symptoms of an arterial embolism in the arms or legs may include:Cold arm or legDecreased or no pulse in an arm or legLack of movement in the arm or legPain in the affected areaNumbness and tingling in the arm or legPale color of the arm or leg (pallor)Weakness of an arm or leg Later symptoms:Blisters of the skin fed by the affected arteryShedding (sloughing) of skinSkin erosion (ulcer)Tissue death (necrosis; skin is dark and damaged) Symptoms of a clot in an organ vary with the organ involved but may include:Pain in the part of the body that is involvedTemporarily decreased organ function Exams and Tests

The health care provider may find decreased or no pulse, and decreased or no blood pressure in the arm or leg. There may be signs of tissue death or gangrene.Tests to diagnose arterial embolism or reveal the source of emboli may include:Angiography of the affected extremity or organDoppler ultrasound exam of an extremityDuplex Doppler ultrasound exam of extremityDuplex Doppler ultrasound exam of arteries to the brainEchocardiogramMRI of the arm or legMyocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE)PlethysmographyTranscranial Doppler exam of arteries to the brainTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) This disease may also affect the results of the following tests:D-dimerFactor VIII assayIsotope study of the affected organPlasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activityPlatelet aggregation testTissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels Treatment

Arterial embolism requires prompt treatment at a hospital. The goals of treatment are to control symptoms and to improve the interrupted blood flow to the affected area of the body. The cause of the clot, if found, should be treated to prevent further problems.Medicines include:Anticoagulants (such as warfarin or heparin or one of the newer blood thinners such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran) can prevent new clots from forming
   Antiplatelet medicines (such as aspirin or clopidogrel) can prevent new clots from forming
   
   Painkillers given through a vein (by IV)
   
   Thrombolytics (such as streptokinase) can dissolve clots
   Some people need surgery. Procedures include:
   Bypass of the artery (arterial bypass) to create a second source of blood supply
   
   Clot removal through a balloon catheter placed into the affected artery or through open surgery on the artery (embolectomy)
   
   Opening of the artery with a balloon catheter (angioplasty) with or without a stent
   Outlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on the location of the clot and how much the clot has blocked blood flow and for how long the blockage has been present. Arterial embolism can be very serious if not treated promptly.The affected area can be permanently damaged. Amputation is needed in up to 1 in 4 cases. Arterial emboli can come back even after successful treatment.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Acute MIInfection in the affected tissueSeptic shockStroke (CVA)Temporary or permanent decrease or loss of other organ functionsTemporary or permanent kidney failureTissue death (necrosis) and gangreneTransient ischemic attack (TIA)When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of arterial embolism.Prevention

Prevention begins with finding possible sources of a blood clot. Your provider may prescribe blood thinners (such as warfarin or heparin) to prevent clots from forming. Antiplatelet drugs may also be needed.You have a higher risk atherosclerosis and clots if you: SmokeDo little exerciseHave high blood pressureHave abnormal cholesterol levelsHave diabetesAre overweightAre stressed Images

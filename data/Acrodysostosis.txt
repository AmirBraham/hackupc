 Acrodysostosis is an extremely rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). It leads to problems with the bones of the hands, feet, and nose, and intellectual disability.Causes

Most people with acrodysostosis have no family history of the disease. However, sometimes the condition is passed down from parent to child. Parents with the condition have a 1 in 2 chance of passing the disorder to their children.There is a slightly greater risk with fathers who are older.Symptoms

Symptoms of this disorder include:Frequent middle ear infectionsGrowth problems, short arms and legsHearing problemsIntellectual disabilityThe body doesn't respond to certain hormones, even though hormone levels are normalDistinct facial features Exams and Tests

The health care provider can usually diagnose this condition with a physical exam. This may show any of the following:Advanced bone ageBone deformities in hands and feetDelays in growthProblems with the skin, genitals, teeth, and skeletonShort arms and legs with small hands and feetShort head, measured front to backShort heightSmall, upturned broad nose with flat bridgeDistinct features of the face (short nose, open mouth, jaw that sticks out)Unusual headWide-spaced eyes, sometimes with extra skin fold at corner of eye In the first months of life, x-rays may show spotty calcium deposits, called stippling, in bones (especially the nose). Infants may also have:Abnormally short fingers and toesEarly growth of bones in the hands and feetShort bonesShortening of the forearm bones near the wrist Two genes have been linked with this condition, and genetic testing may be done.Treatment

Treatment depends on the symptoms.Hormones, such as growth hormone, may be given. Surgery to treat bone problems may be done.Support Groups

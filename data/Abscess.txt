 An abscess is a collection of pus in any part of the body. In most cases, the area around an abscess is swollen and inflamed.Causes

Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight and contain it. White blood cells (WBCs) move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect in the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances.Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances.Abscesses in the skin are easy to see. They are red, raised, and painful. Abscesses in other areas of the body may not be seen, but they may cause organ damage.Some types and locations of abscesses include:Abdominal abscessAmebic liver abscessAnorectal abscessBartholin gland abscessBrain abscessEpidural abscessPeritonsillar abscessPyogenic liver abscessSpinal cord abscessSubcutaneous (skin) abscessTooth abscessExams and Tests

Treatment varies, but often surgery is needed to drain the abscess. Antibiotics can also be used.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you think that you have any type of abscess. Contact your dentist if you think that you have a tooth abscess.Prevention

Preventing abscesses depends on where they develop. For example, good hygiene can help prevent skin abscesses. Dental hygiene and routine care will prevent tooth abscesses.Images

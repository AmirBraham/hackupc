 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of anxiety disorder. It can occur after you have gone through an extreme emotional trauma that involved the threat of injury or death.Causes

Health care providers do not know why traumatic events cause PTSD in some people, but not in others. Your genes, emotions, and family setting may all play roles. Past emotional trauma may increase your risk of PTSD after a recent traumatic event.With PTSD, the body's response to a stressful event is changed. Normally, after the event, the body recovers. The stress hormones and chemicals the body releases due to the stress go back to normal levels. For some reason in a person with PTSD, the body keeps releasing the stress hormones and chemicals.PTSD can occur at any age. It can occur after events such as:AssaultCar accidentsDomestic abuseNatural disastersPrison staySexual assaultTerrorismWar Symptoms

There are 4 types of PTSD symptoms:1. Reliving the event, which disturbs day-to-day activityFlashback episodes in which the event seems to be happening again and againRepeated upsetting memories of the eventRepeated nightmares of the eventStrong, uncomfortable reactions to situations that remind you of the event 2. AvoidanceEmotional numbing or feeling as though you do not care about anythingFeeling detachedNot able to remember important parts of the eventNot interested in normal activitiesShowing less of your moodsAvoiding places, people, or thoughts that remind you of the eventFeeling like you have no future 3. HyperarousalAlways scanning your surroundings for signs of danger (hypervigilance)Not able to concentrateStartling easilyFeeling irritable or having outbursts of angerTrouble falling or staying asleep 4. Negative thoughts and mood or feelingsConstant guilt about the event, including survivor guiltBlaming others for the eventNot being able to recall important parts of the eventLoss of interest in activities or other peopleYou may also have symptoms of anxiety, stress, and tension:Agitation or excitabilityDizzinessFaintingFeeling your heart beat in your chestHeadache Exams and Tests

Your provider may ask how long you have had symptoms. PTSD is diagnosed when you have had symptoms for at least 30 days.Your provider may also do a mental health exam, physical exam, and blood tests. These are done to look for other illnesses that are similar to PTSD.Treatment

Treatment for PTSD involves talk therapy (counseling), medicines, or both.TALK THERAPYDuring talk therapy, you talk with a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or therapist, in a calm and accepting setting. They can help you manage your PTSD symptoms. They will also guide you as you work through your feelings about the trauma.There are many types of talk therapy. One type that is often used for PTSD is called desensitization. During therapy, you are encouraged to remember the traumatic event and express your feelings about it. Over time, memories of the event become less frightening.During talk therapy, you may also learn ways to relax, such as when you start to have flashbacks.MEDICINESYour provider may suggest that you take medicines. They can help ease your depression or anxiety. They can also help you sleep better. Medicines need time to work. DO NOT stop taking them or change the amount (dosage) you take without talking to your provider. Ask your provider about possible side effects and what to do if you experience them.Support Groups

Support groups, whose members are people who have similar experiences with PTSD, can be helpful. Ask your provider about groups in your area.Support groups are usually not a good substitute for talk therapy or taking medicine, but they can be a helpful addition.Anxiety and Depression Association of America -- adaa.orgNational Institute of Mental Health -- www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtmlIf you are a caregiver of a military veteran, you can find support and encouragement through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs at www.ptsd.va.gov.Outlook (Prognosis)

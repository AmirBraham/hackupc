 Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. The condition is often called overactive thyroid.Causes

The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system. It is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet. The gland makes the hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism.Many diseases and conditions can cause hyperthyroidism, including:Graves disease (most common cause of hyperthyroidism)Inflammation (thyroiditis) of the thyroid due to viral infections, some medicines, or after pregnancy (common)Taking too much thyroid hormone (common)Noncancerous growths of the thyroid gland or pituitary gland (rare)Some tumors of the testes or ovaries (rare)Getting medical imaging tests with contrast dye that has iodine (rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid)Eating too much of foods that contain iodine (very rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid) Symptoms

Common symptoms include:AnxietyDifficulty concentratingFatigueFrequent bowel movementsGoiter (visibly enlarged thyroid gland) or thyroid nodulesHair lossHand tremorHeat intoleranceIncreased appetiteIncreased sweatingIrregular menstrual periods in womenNail changes (thickness or flaking)NervousnessPounding or racing heart beat (palpitations)RestlessnessSleep problemsWeight loss (or weight gain, in some cases) Other symptoms that can occur with this condition:Breast development in menClammy skinDiarrheaFeeling faint when you raise your handsHigh blood pressureItchy or irritated eyesItchy skinNausea and vomitingProtruding eyes (exophthalmos)Skin blushing or flushingSkin rash on the shinsWeakness of the hips and shoulders Exams and Tests

The health care provider will do a physical exam. The exam may find the following:High systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading)Increased heart rateEnlarged thyroid glandShaking of the handsSwelling or inflammation around the eyesVery strong reflexesSkin, hair, and nail changesBlood tests are also ordered to measure your thyroid hormones TSH, T3, and T4.You may also have blood tests to check:Cholesterol levelsGlucoseSpecialized thyroid tests like Thyroid receptor antibody (TRAb) or Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI)Imaging tests of the thyroid may also be needed, including:Radioactive iodine uptake and scanThyroid ultrasound (rarely)Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause and severity of symptoms. Hyperthyroidism is usually treated with one or more of the following:Antithyroid medicines (propylthiouracil or methimazole) which reduce or block the effects of the extra thyroid hormone Radioactive iodine to destroy the thyroid gland and stop the excess production of hormonesSurgery to remove the thyroid If your thyroid is removed with surgery or destroyed with radioactive iodine, you must take thyroid hormone replacement pills for the rest of your life.Medicines called beta-blockers may be prescribed to treat symptoms such as fast heart rate, tremor, sweating, and anxiety until the hyperthyroidism can be controlled.Outlook (Prognosis)

Hyperthyroidism is treatable. Some causes may go away without treatment.Hyperthyroidism caused by Graves disease usually gets worse over time. It has many complications, some of which are severe and affect quality of life.Possible Complications

Thyroid crisis (also called thyroid storm) is a sudden worsening of hyperthyroidism symptoms that may occur with infection or stress. Fever, decreased alertness, and abdominal pain may occur. People need to be treated in the hospital.Other complications of hyperthyroidism include:Heart problems such as fast heart rate, abnormal heart rhythm, and heart failureOsteoporosis Eye disease (double vision, ulcers of the cornea, vision loss)Surgery-related complications, including: Scarring of the neckHoarseness due to nerve damage to the voice boxLow calcium level due to damage to the parathyroid glands (located near the thyroid gland)Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)Tobacco use may make some complications of hyperthyroidism worse.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Go to an emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have:Change in consciousnessDizzinessRapid, irregular heartbeat Contact your provider if you are being treated for hyperthyroidism and you develop symptoms of underactive thyroid, including:DepressionMental and physical sluggishnessWeight gain Alternative Names

 ESR stands for erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It is commonly called a "sed rate."It is a test that indirectly measures the level of certain proteins in the blood. This measurement correlates with the amount of inflammation in the body.How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The blood sample is sent to a lab.The test measures how fast red blood cells (called erythrocytes) fall to the bottom of a tall, thin tube.How to Prepare for the Test

There are no special steps needed to prepare for this test.How the Test will Feel

You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.Why the Test is Performed

Reasons why a "sed rate" may be done include:Unexplained feversCertain types of joint pain or arthritisMuscle symptomsHeadacheOther vague symptoms that cannot be explainedThis test may also be used to monitor whether an illness is responding to treatment. This test can be used to monitor inflammatory diseases or cancer. It is not used to diagnose a specific disorder.However, the test is useful for detecting and monitoring:Autoimmune disordersBone infectionsCertain forms of arthritisInflammatory diseasesNormal Results

For adults (Westergren method):Men under 50 years old: less than 15 mm/hrMen over 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hrWomen under 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hrWomen over 50 years old: less than 30 mm/hr For children (Westergren method):Newborn: 0 to 2 mm/hrNewborn to puberty: 3 to 13 mm/hr Note: mm/hr = millimeters per hourNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

An abnormal ESR may help with a diagnosis, but it does not prove that you have a certain condition. Other tests are almost always needed.An increased ESR rate may occur in people with:AnemiaCancers such as lymphoma or multiple myelomaKidney diseasePregnancyThyroid disease The immune system helps protect the body against harmful substances. An autoimmune disorder is when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. ESR is often higher than normal in people with an autoimmune disorder.Common autoimmune disorders include:LupusPolymyalgia rheumaticaRheumatoid arthritis in adults or childrenVery high ESR levels occur with less common autoimmune or other disorders, including:Allergic vasculitisGiant cell arteritisHyperfibrinogenemia (increased fibrinogen levels in the blood)Macroglobulinemia - primaryNecrotizing vasculitisAn increased ESR rate may be due to some infections, including:Bodywide (systemic) infectionBone infectionsInfection of the heart or heart valvesRheumatic feverSevere skin infections, such as erysipelasTuberculosisLower-than-normal levels occur with:Congestive heart failureHyperviscosityHypofibrinogenemia (decreased fibrinogen levels)LeukemiaÂ Low plasma protein (due to liver or kidney disease)PolycythemiaSickle cell anemiaAlternative Names

 Hematocrit is a blood test that measures how much of a person's blood is made up of red blood cells. This measurement depends on the number of and size of the red blood cells.How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is necessary for this test.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.Why the Test is Performed

The hematocrit is almost always done as part of a complete blood count (CBC).Your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs of or are at risk for anemia. These include having:Before and after major surgeryBlood in your stools, or vomit (if you throw up)Chronic medical problems, such as kidney disease or certain types of arthritisDuring pregnancyFatigue, poor health, or unexplained weight lossHeadachesHeavy menstrual periodsLeukemia or other problems in the bone marrowMonitoring during treatment for cancerMonitoring medicines that may cause anemia or low blood countsMonitoring of anemia and its causePoor nutritionProblems concentratingNormal Results

Normal results vary, but in general they are:Male: 40.7% to 50.3%Female: 36.1% to 44.3%For babies, normal results are:Newborn: 45% to 61%Infant: 32% to 42%The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Low hematocrit may be due to:AnemiaBleedingBone marrow being unable to produce new red blood cells. This may be due to leukemia, other cancers, drug toxicity, radiation therapy, infection, or bone marrow disordersÂ Chronic illnessChronic kidney diseaseDestruction of red blood cells (hemolysis)LeukemiaMalnutritionToo little iron, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 in the dietToo much water in the body High hematocrit may be due to:Bone marrow disease that causes abnormal increase in red blood cells (polycythemia vera)Congenital heart diseaseExposure to high altitudeFailure of the right side of the heartLow levels of oxygen in the bloodScarring or thickening of the lungsToo little water in the body (dehydration)Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:Excessive bleedingFainting or feeling lightheadedMultiple punctures to locate veinsHematoma (blood buildup under the skin)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names

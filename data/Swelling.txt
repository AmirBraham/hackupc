 Swelling is the enlargement of organs, skin, or other body parts. It is caused by a buildup of fluid in the tissues. The extra fluid can lead to a rapid increase in weight over a short period of time (days to weeks).Swelling can occur all over the body (generalized) or only in one part of the body (localized).Considerations

Slight swelling (edema) of the lower legs is common in warm summer months, especially if a person has been standing or walking a lot.General swelling, or massive edema (also called anasarca), is a common sign in people who are very sick. Although slight edema may be hard to detect, a large amount of swelling is obvious.Edema is described as pitting or non-pitting.Pitting edema leaves a dent in the skin after you press the area with a finger for about 5 seconds. The dent will slowly fill back in.Non-pitting edema does not leave this type of dent when pressing on the swollen area.Causes

Swelling can be caused by any of the following:Acute glomerulonephritis (a kidney disease)Burns, including sunburnChronic kidney diseaseHeart failureLiver failure from cirrhosisNephrotic syndrome (a kidney disease)Poor nutritionPregnancyThyroid diseaseToo little albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia)Too much salt or sodiumUse of certain drugs, such as corticosteroids or drugs used to treat heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes Home Care

Follow your health care provider's treatment recommendations. If you have long-term swelling, ask your provider about options to prevent skin breakdown, such as: Flotation ringLamb's wool padPressure-reducing mattress Continue with your everyday activities. When lying down, keep your arms and legs above your heart level, if possible, so the fluid can drain. DO NOT do this if you get shortness of breath. See your provider instead.When to Contact a Medical Professional

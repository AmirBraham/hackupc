The tissue is removed by using a tiny tool or a brush at the end of the scope.The sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture) and watched for the growth of bacteria, fungi, or viruses.Other tests may be done to determine what medicine can best treat the organism.How to Prepare for the Test

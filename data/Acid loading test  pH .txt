 The acid loading test (pH) measures the ability of the kidneys to send acid to the urine when there is too much acid in the blood. This test involves both a blood test and urine test.How the Test is Performed

Before the test, you will need to take a medicine called ammonium chloride for 3 days. Follow instructions exactly on how to take it to ensure an accurate result.Samples of urine and blood are then taken.How to Prepare for the Test

Your health care provider will tell you to take ammonium chloride capsules by mouth for 3 days before the test.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.The urine test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.Why the Test is Performed

This test is done to see how well your kidneys control the body's acid-base balance.Normal Results

Urine with a pH less than 5.3 is normal.Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

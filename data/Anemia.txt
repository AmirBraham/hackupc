 Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.Different types of anemia include:Anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiencyAnemia due to folate (folic acid) deficiencyAnemia due to iron deficiencyAnemia of chronic diseaseHemolytic anemiaIdiopathic aplastic anemiaMegaloblastic anemiaPernicious anemiaSickle cell anemiaThalassemiaIron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia.Causes

Although many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (epo) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin.The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to:Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines that affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease)Poor dietSurgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines Possible causes of anemia include:Iron deficiencyVitamin B12 deficiencyFolate deficiencyCertain medicinesDestruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems)Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis, or rheumatoid arthritisSome forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inheritedPregnancyProblems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia, myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma, or aplastic anemiaSlow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers)Sudden heavy blood loss Symptoms

You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild or if the problem develops slowly. Symptoms that may occur first include:Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exerciseHeadachesProblems concentrating or thinkingIrritabilityLoss of appetiteNumbness and tingling of hands and feet If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:Blue color to the whites of the eyesBrittle nailsDesire to eat ice or other non-food things (pica syndrome)Lightheadedness when you stand upPale skin colorShortness of breath with mild activity or even at restSore or inflamed tongueMouth ulcersAbnormal or increased menstrual bleeding in femalesLoss of sexual desire in men Exams and Tests

The provider will perform a physical examination, and may find:A heart murmurLow blood pressure, especially when you stand upSlight feverPale skinRapid heart rate Some types of anemia may cause other findings on a physical exam.Blood tests used to diagnose some common types of anemia may include:Blood levels of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and other vitamins and mineralsComplete blood countReticulocyte countOther tests may be done to find medical problems that can cause anemia.Treatment

Treatment should be directed at the cause of the anemia, and may include:Blood transfusionsCorticosteroids or other medicines that suppress the immune systemErythropoietin, a medicine that helps your bone marrow make more blood cellsSupplements of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, or other vitamins and minerals Possible Complications

Severe anemia can cause low oxygen levels in vital organs such as the heart, and can lead to heart failure.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have any symptoms of anemia or unusual bleeding.Images

 Hemorrhoids are swollen veins around the anus. They may be inside the anus (internal hemorrhoids) or outside the anus (external hemorrhoids).Often hemorrhoids do not cause problems. But if hemorrhoids bleed a lot, cause pain, or become swollen, hard, and painful, surgery can remove them.Description

Hemorrhoid surgery can be done in your surgeon's office or in the hospital operating room. In most cases, you can go home the same day. The type of surgery you have depends on your symptoms and the location and size of the hemorrhoid.Before the surgery, your surgeon will numb the area so you can stay awake, but not feel anything. For some types of surgery, you may be given general anesthesia. This means you will be given medicine in your vein that puts you to sleep and keeps you pain-free during surgery.Hemorrhoid surgery may involve:Putting a small rubber band around a hemorrhoid to shrink it by blocking blood flow.Stapling a hemorrhoid to block blood flow, causing it to shrink.Using a knife (scalpel) to remove hemorrhoids. You may or may not have stitches.Injecting a chemical into the blood vessel of the hemorrhoid to shrink it.Using a laser to burn the hemorrhoid.Why the Procedure is Performed

Often you can manage small hemorrhoids by:Eating a high fiber dietDrinking more waterAvoiding constipation (taking a fiber supplement if needed)Not straining when you have a bowel movementWhen these measures do not work and you are having bleeding and pain, your health care provider may recommend hemorrhoid surgery.Risks

Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:Reactions to medicines, breathing problemsBleeding, blood clots, infectionRisks for this type of surgery include:Leaking a small amount of stool (long-term problems are rare)Problems passing urine because of the painBefore the Procedure

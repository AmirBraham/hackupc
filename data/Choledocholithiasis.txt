 Choledocholithiasis is the presence of at least one gallstone in the common bile duct. The stone may be made up of bile pigments or calcium and cholesterol salts.Causes

About 1 in 7 people with gallstones will develop stones in the common bile duct. This is the small tube that carries bile from the gallbladder to the intestine.Risk factors include a history of gallstones. However, choledocholithiasis can occur in people who have had their gallbladder removed.Symptoms

Often, there are no symptoms unless the stone blocks the common bile duct. Symptoms may include:Pain in the right upper or middle upper abdomen for at least 30 minutes. The pain may be constant and intense. It can be mild or severe.Fever.Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).Loss of appetite.Nausea and vomiting.Clay-colored stools.Exams and Tests

Tests that show the location of stones in the bile duct include the following:Abdominal CT scanAbdominal ultrasoundEndoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP)Endoscopic ultrasoundMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTCA)Your health care provider may order the following blood tests:BilirubinComplete blood count (CBC)Liver function testsPancreatic enzymes (amylase or lipase)Treatment

The goal of treatment is to relieve the blockage.Treatment may involve:Surgery to remove the gallbladder and stonesERCP and a procedure called a sphincterotomy, which makes a surgical cut into the muscle in the common bile duct to allow stones to pass or be removedOutlook (Prognosis)

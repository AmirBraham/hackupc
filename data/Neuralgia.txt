 Neuralgia is a sharp, shocking pain that follows the path of a nerve and is due to irritation or damage to the nerve.Common neuralgias include:Postherpetic neuralgia (pain that continues after a bout of shingles)Trigeminal neuralgia (stabbing or electric-shock-like pain in parts of the face)Alcoholic neuropathyPeripheral neuropathyCauses

Causes of neuralgia include:Chemical irritationChronic kidney diseaseDiabetesInfections, such as herpes zoster (shingles), HIV/AIDS, Lyme disease, and syphilisMedicines such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, or vincristinePorphyria (blood disorder)Pressure on nerves by nearby bones, ligaments, blood vessels, or tumorsTrauma (including surgery) In many cases, the cause is unknown. 
 Postherpetic neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia are the two most common forms of neuralgia. A related but less common neuralgia affects the glossopharyngeal nerve, which provides feeling to the throat.Neuralgia is more common in older people, but it may occur at any age.Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Increased sensitivity of the skin along the path of the damaged nerve, so that any touch or pressure is felt as painPain along the path of the nerve that is sharp or stabbing, in the same location each episode, comes and goes (intermittent) or is constant and burning, and may get worse when the area is movedWeakness or complete paralysis of muscles supplied by the same nerve Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam, and ask about your symptoms.The exam may show:Abnormal sensation in the skinReflex problemsLoss of muscle massLack of sweating (sweating is controlled by nerves)Tenderness along a nerveTrigger points (areas where even a slight touch triggers pain) You may also need to see a dentist if the pain is in your face or jaw. A dental exam can rule out dental disorders that may cause facial pain (such as a tooth abscess). Other symptoms (such as redness or swelling) may help rule out conditions such as infections, bone fractures, or rheumatoid arthritis.There are no specific tests for neuralgia. But, the following tests may be done to find the cause of the pain:Blood tests to check blood sugar, kidney function, and other possible causes of neuralgiaMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Nerve conduction study with electromyographyUltrasoundSpinal tap (lumbar puncture) Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause, location, and severity of the pain.Medicines to control pain may include:AntidepressantsAntiseizure drugsOver-the-counter or prescription pain medicinesPain medicines in the form of skin patches or creamsOther treatments may include:Shots with pain-relieving (anesthetic) drugsNerve blocksPhysical therapy (for some types of neuralgia, especially postherpetic neuralgia)Procedures to reduce feeling in the nerve (such as nerve ablation using radiofrequency, heat, balloon compression, or injection of chemicals)Surgery to take pressure off a nerveAlternative therapy, such as acupuncture or biofeedbackProcedures may not improve symptoms and can cause loss of feeling or abnormal sensations.When other treatments fail, doctors may try nerve or spinal cord stimulation. In rare cases, a procedure called motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is tried. An electrode is placed over part of nerve, spinal cord, or brain and is hooked to a pulse generator under the skin. This changes how your nerves signal and it may reduce pain.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most neuralgias are not life threatening and are not signs of other life-threatening disorders. For severe pain that does not improve, see a pain specialist so that you can explore all treatment options.Most neuralgias respond to treatment. Attacks of pain usually come and go. But, attacks may become more frequent in some people as they get older.Sometimes, the condition may improve on its own or disappear with time, even when the cause is not found.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Problems from surgeryDisability caused by painSide effects of drugs used to control painDental procedures that aren't needed before neuralgia is diagnosedWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if:You develop shinglesYou have symptoms of neuralgia, especially if over-the-counter pain medicines do not relieve your painYou have severe pain (see a pain specialist)Prevention

Strict control of blood sugar may prevent nerve damage in people with diabetes. In the case of shingles, antiviral drugs and the herpes zoster virus vaccine may prevent neuralgia.Alternative Names

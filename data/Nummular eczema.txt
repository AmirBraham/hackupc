 Eczema is often treated with medicines applied to the skin. These are called topical medicines, and may include:A mild cortisone (steroid) cream or ointment at first.

This involves the following steps:Apply petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) or corticosteroid ointment to the lesions.Wrap the affected area with wet bandages to keep the skin moist. This also helps the medicine work. If larger areas of the body are affected, you can wear damp pajamas or a sauna suit.Apply a warm towel or wear dry clothes over the wet bandage or wet pajamas.Follow your provider's instructions for how long to keep the area covered, and how many times a day to do the wet wrap treatment.The following measures may help improve your symptoms or prevent them from returning if your skin has cleared:Use lukewarm water when bathing and showering.

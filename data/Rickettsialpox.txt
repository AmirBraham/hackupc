 Rickettsialpox is a disease spread by a mite. It causes a chickenpox-like rash on the body.Causes

Rickettsialpox is caused by the bacteria, Rickettsia akari. It is commonly found in the United States in New York City and other city areas. It also has been seen in Europe, South Africa, Korea, and Russia.The bacteria are spread by the bite of a mite that lives on mice.Symptoms

The disease begins at the site of the mite bite as a painless, firm, red lump (nodule). The nodule develops into a fluid-filled blister that bursts and crusts over. This lump may be up to 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide. These lumps usually appear on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. They do not appear on the palms of hands and soles of feet. Symptoms usually develop 6 to 15 days after coming in contact with the bacteria.Other symptoms may include:Discomfort in bright light (photophobia)Fever and chillsHeadacheMuscle painRash that looks like chickenpoxSweating Runny noseSore throatCoughEnlarged lymph nodesLoss of appetiteNausea or vomitingThe rash is not painful and usually clears within a week.Exams and Tests

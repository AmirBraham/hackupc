 A glomus tympanum tumor is a tumor of the middle ear and bone behind the ear (mastoid).Causes

A glomus tympanum tumor grows in the temporal bone of the skull, behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane).This area contains nerve fibers (glomus bodies) that normally respond to changes in body temperature or blood pressure.These tumors most often occur late in life, around age 60 or 70, but they can appear at any age.The cause of a glomus tympanum tumor is unknown. In most cases, there are no known risk factors. Glomus tumors have been associated with changes (mutations) in a gene responsible for the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHD).Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Hearing problems or lossRinging in the ear (pulsatile tinnitus)Weakness or loss of movement in the face (facial nerve palsy) Exams and Tests

 Treacher Collins syndrome is a genetic condition that leads to problems with the structure of the face. Most cases are not passed down through families.Causes

However, most of the time, there is not another affected family member.This condition may vary in severity from generation to generation and from person to person.Symptoms

An exam of the infant may reveal a variety of problems, including:Abnormal eye shapeFlat cheekbonesCleft palate or lipSmall jawLow-set earsAbnormally formed earsAbnormal ear canalHearing lossDefects in the eyeDecreased eyelashes on the lower eyelidGenetic tests can help identify gene changes linked to this condition.Treatment

 Aortic angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through the aorta. The aorta is the major artery. It carries blood out of the heart, and through your abdomen or belly.Angiography uses x-rays and a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.How the Test is Performed

This test is done at a hospital. Before the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax.An area of your body, most often in your arm or groin area, is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic).A radiologist or cardiologist will place a needle into the groin blood vessel. A guidewire and a long tube (catheter) will be passed through this needle.The catheter is moved into the aorta. The doctor can see live images of the aorta on a TV-like monitor. X-rays are used to guide the catheter to the correct position.Once the catheter is in place, dye is injected into it. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the aorta. The dye helps detect any blockages in blood flow. After the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The leg is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.How to Prepare for the Test

You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.You will wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure. Remove jewelry from the area being studied.Tell your health care provider:If you are pregnantIf you have ever had any allergic reactions to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substancesIf you are allergic to any medicinesWhich medicines you are taking (including any herbal preparations)If you have ever had any bleeding problems You will be awake during the test. You may feel a sting as the numbing medicine is given and some pressure as the catheter is inserted. You may feel a warm flushing when the contrast dye flows through the catheter. This is normal and most often goes away in a few seconds.You may have some discomfort from lying on the hospital table and staying still for a long time.In most cases, you can resume normal activity the day after the procedure.Why the Test is Performed

Your provider may ask for this test if there are signs or symptoms of a problem with the aorta or its branches, including:Aortic aneurysmAortic dissectionCongenital (present from birth) problemsAV malformationDouble aortic archCoarctation of the aortaVascular ringInjury to the aortaTakayasu arteritisWhat Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be due to:Abdominal aortic aneurysmAortic dissectionAortic regurgitationCongenital (present from birth) problemsDouble aortic archCoarctation of the aortaVascular ringInjury to the aortaMesenteric artery disease or ischemiaPeripheral artery diseaseRenal artery stenosisTakayasu arteritisRisks

Risks of aortic angiography include:Allergic reaction to the contrast dyeBlockage of the arteryBlood clot that travels to the lungsBruising at the site of catheter insertionDamage to the blood vessel where the needle and catheter are insertedExcessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the legHeart attack or strokeHematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle punctureInfectionInjury to the nerves at the needle puncture siteKidney damage from the dye Considerations

This procedure may be done with left heart catheterization to look for coronary artery disease.Aortic angiography has been mostly replaced by computed tomography (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.Alternative Names

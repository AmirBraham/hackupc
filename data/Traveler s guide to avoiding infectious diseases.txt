Some strains of malaria are resistant to some preventive medicines. You should also take steps to prevent insect bites.ZIKA VIRUSZika is a virus passed to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, joint pain, rash, and red eyes (conjunctivitis). The mosquitoes that spread Zika are the same type that spread dengue fever and chikungunya virus. These mosquitoes usually feed during the day. No vaccine exists for preventing Zika.There is believed to be a link between mothers with Zika infection and babies born with microcephaly and other birth defects. Zika can spread from a mother to her baby in the uterus (in utero) or at the time of birth. A man with Zika can spread the disease to his sex partners. There have been reports of Zika spreading through blood transfusion.Before 2015, the virus was found mainly in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It has now spread to many states and countries including:BrazilCaribbean IslandsCentral AmericaMexicoNorth AmericaSouth AmericaPuerto RicoThe disease has been found in certain regions of the United States. For the most up-to-date information, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website -- www.cdc.gov/zika.To prevent getting the Zika virus, take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Sexual transmission of the virus can be prevented by using condoms or not having sex with a person who is possibly infected.PREVENTING INSECT BITESTo prevent against bites from mosquitoes and other insects:Wear insect repellent when you are outdoors, but use it safely. Conventional repellents include DEET and picaridin.

 Anterior vaginal wall repair is a surgical procedure. This surgery tightens the front (anterior) wall of the vagina.Description

The anterior vaginal wall can sink (prolapse) or bulge. This occurs when the bladder or the urethra sink into the vagina.The repair may be done while you are under:General anesthesia: You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.Spinal anesthesia: You will be awake, but you will be numb from the waist down and you will not feel pain. You will be given medicines to help you relax.Your surgeon will:Make a surgical cut through the front wall of your vagina.Move your bladder back to its normal location.May fold your vagina, or cut away part of it.Put sutures (stitches) in the tissue between your vagina and bladder. These will hold the walls of your vagina in the correct position.Place a patch between your bladder and vagina. This patch can be made of commercially available biological material (cadaveric tissue).

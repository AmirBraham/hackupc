 Meatal stenosis is a narrowing of the opening of the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body.Causes

Meatal stenosis can affect both males and females. It is more common in males.In males, it is often caused by swelling and irritation (inflammation). In most cases, this problem occurs in newborns after circumcision. Abnormal scar tissue can grow across the opening of the urethra, causing it to narrow. The problem may not be detected until the child is toilet trained.In adult men, the condition can result from surgery on the urethra, ongoing use of an indwelling catheter, or a procedure to treat an enlarged prostate gland (BPH).In females, this condition is present at birth (congenital). Less commonly, meatal stenosis may also affect adult women. Risks include:Having many endoscopic procedures (cystoscopy)Severe, long-term atrophic vaginitisSymptoms

Symptoms include:Abnormal strength and direction of urine streamBed wettingBleeding (hematuria) at end of urinationDiscomfort with urination or straining with urinationIncontinence (day or night)Visible narrowing of the urethral opening in boys Exams and Tests

In men and boys, a history and physical exam are enough to make the diagnosis.In girls, a voiding cystourethrogram may be done. The narrowing may also be found during a physical exam or when a health care provider tries to place a Foley catheter.Other tests may include:Kidney and bladder ultrasoundUrine analysisUrine cultureTreatment

In females, meatal stenosis is most often treated in the provider's office. This is done using local anesthesia to numb the area. Then the opening of the urethra is widened (dilated) with special instruments.In boys, a minor outpatient surgery called meatoplasty is the treatment of choice. Dilation of the meatus may also be appropriate in some cases.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most people will urinate normally after treatment.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Abnormal urine streamBlood in the urineFrequent urinationPainful urinationUrinary incontinenceUrinary tract infectionsDamage to bladder or kidney function in severe casesWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if your child has symptoms of this disorder.Prevention

If your baby boy has recently been circumcised, try to keep the diaper clean and dry. Avoid exposing the newly circumcised penis to any irritants. They may cause inflammation and narrowing of the opening.Alternative Names

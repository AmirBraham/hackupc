 Dizziness is a term that is often used to describe 2 different symptoms: lightheadedness and vertigo.Lightheadedness is a feeling that you might faint.Vertigo is a feeling that you are spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around you. Vertigo-associated disorders is a related topic.Considerations

Most causes of dizziness are not serious, and they either quickly get better on their own or are easy to treat.Causes

Lightheadedness occurs when your brain does not get enough blood. This may occur if:You have a sudden drop in blood pressure.Your body does not have enough water (is dehydrated) because of vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or other conditions.You get up too quickly after sitting or lying down (this is more common in older people). Lightheadedness may also occur if you have the flu, low blood sugar, a cold, allergies, or take medicines that may lower your blood pressure.More serious conditions that can lead to lightheadedness include:Heart problems, such as a heart attack or abnormal heart beatStrokeBleeding inside the bodyShock (extreme drop in blood pressure) If any of these serious disorders are present, you will usually also have symptoms like chest pain, a feeling of a racing heart, loss of speech, change in vision, or other symptoms.Vertigo may be due to:Benign positional vertigo, a spinning feeling that occurs when you move your headLabyrinthitis, a viral infection of the inner ear that usually follows a cold or fluMeniere disease, a common inner ear problem Other causes of lightheadedness or vertigo may include:Use of certain medicinesStrokeMultiple sclerosisSeizuresBrain tumorBleeding in the brain Home Care

If you tend to get lightheaded when you stand up:Avoid sudden changes in posture.Get up from a lying position slowly, and stay seated for a few moments before standing.When standing, make sure you have something to hold on to. If you have vertigo, the following tips can help prevent your symptoms from becoming worse:Keep still and rest when symptoms occur.Avoid sudden movements or position changes.Slowly increase activity.You may need a cane or other help walking when you have a loss of balance during a vertigo attack.Avoid bright lights, TV, and reading during vertigo attacks because they may make symptoms worse. Avoid activities such as driving, operating heavy machinery, and climbing until 1 week after your symptoms disappear. A sudden dizzy spell during these activities can be dangerous.When to Contact a Medical Professional

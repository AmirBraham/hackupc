How well someone does depends on how much meclofenamate was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.A mild overdose of meclofenamate does not usually cause serious problems. The person may have some stomach pain and vomiting (possibly with blood).However, a large amount of internal bleeding is possible, and a blood transfusion may be needed. Passing a tube with a camera through the mouth into the stomach may be needed to stop the internal bleeding.If kidney damage is severe, dialysis may be needed until kidney function returns. In some cases, the damage is permanent.A large overdose can cause serious damage to children and adults. Death may occur.References

 Selective mutism is a condition in which a child can speak, but then suddenly stops speaking. It most often takes place in school or social settings.Causes

Selective mutism is most common in children under age 5. The cause, or causes, are unknown. Most experts believe that children with the condition inherit a tendency to be anxious and inhibited. Most children with selective mutism have some form of extreme social fear (phobia).Parents often think that the child is choosing not to speak. However in most cases, the child is truly unable to speak in certain settings.Some affected children have a family history of selective mutism, extreme shyness, or anxiety disorders, which may increase their risk for similar problems. This syndrome is not the same as mutism. In selective mutism, the child can understand and speak, but is unable to speak in certain settings or environments. Children with mutism never speak.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Ability to speak at home with familyFear or anxiety around people they do not know wellInability to speak in certain social situationsShyness This pattern must be seen for at least 1 month to be called selective mutism. (The first month of school does not count, because shyness is common during this period.)Exams and Tests

There is no test for selective mutism. Diagnosis is based on the person's history of symptoms.Teachers and counselors should consider cultural issues, such as recently moving to a new country and speaking another language. Children who are uncertain about speaking a new language may not want to use it outside of a familiar setting. This is not selective mutism.The person's history of mutism should also be considered. People who have been through trauma may show some of the same symptoms seen in selective mutism.Treatment

Treating selective mutism involves behavior changes. The child's family and school should be involved. Certain medicines that treat anxiety and social phobia have been used safely and successfully.Support Groups

You can find information and resources through selective mutism support groups.Outlook (Prognosis)

Children with this syndrome can have different outcomes. Some may need to continue therapy for shyness and social anxiety into the teenage years, and possibly into adulthood.Possible Complications

Selective mutism can affect the child's ability to function in school or social settings. Without treatment, symptoms may get worse.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if your child has symptoms of selective mutism, and it is affecting school and social activities.References

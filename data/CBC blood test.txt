 A complete blood count (CBC) test measures the following:The number of white blood cells (WBC count)The number of red blood cells (RBC count)The number of plateletsThe total amount of hemoglobin in the bloodThe fraction of the blood composed of red blood cells (hematocrit) The CBC test also provides information about the following measurements:Mean red blood cell volume (MCV)
   Mean hemoglobin amount per red blood cell (MCH)The mean amount of hemoglobin relative to the size of the cell (hemoglobin concentration) per red blood cell (MCHC) How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test

There is no special preparation needed.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain. Some people feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.Why the Test is Performed

A CBC is a commonly performed lab test. It can be used to detect or monitor many different health conditions. Your health care provider may order this test:If you are having symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, fever or other signs of an infection, weakness, bruising, bleeding, or any signs of cancerWhen you are receiving treatments (medicines or radiation) that may change your blood count resultsTo monitor a long-term (chronic) health problem that may change your blood count results, such as chronic kidney disease Normal Results

Blood counts may vary with altitude. In general, normal results are: RBC count:Male: 4.7 to 6.1 million cells/mcLFemale: 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcL WBC count: 4,500 to 10,000 cells/mcL Hematocrit: Male: 40.7% to 50.3%Female: 36.1% to 44.3% Hemoglobin: Male: 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dLFemale: 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dL Red blood cell indices:MCV: 80 to 95 femtoliterMCH: 27 to 31 pg/cellMCHC: 32 to 36 gm/dL Platelet count:150,000 to 450,000/dL The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean

High RBC, hemoglobin, or hematocrit may be due to:A lack of enough water and fluids, such as from severe diarrhea, excessive sweating, or water pills used to treat high blood pressureKidney disease with high erythropoietin productionLow oxygen level in the blood for a long time, most often due to heart or lung disease, chronic carbon monoxide exposure, or living at a high altitudePolycythemia veraSmoking Use of testosteroneLow RBC, hemoglobin, or hematocrit is a sign of anemia, which can result from:Blood loss (either sudden, or from problems such as heavy menstrual periods over a long time)Bone marrow failure (for example, from radiation, infection, or tumor)Breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis)Cancer and cancer treatmentCertain long-term (chronic) medical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, ulcerative colitis, or rheumatoid arthritisIron deficiencyLeukemiaLong-term infections such as hepatitisPoor diet and nutrition, causing too little iron, folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6Multiple myelomaA lower than normal white blood cell count is called leukopenia. A decreased WBC count may be due to:Alcohol abuse and liver damageAutoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus)Bone marrow failure (for example, due to infection, tumor, radiation, or fibrosis)Chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancerDisease of the liver or spleenEnlarged spleenInfections caused by viruses, such as mono or AIDSMedicines A high WBC count is called leukocytosis. It can result from:Certain medicines, such as corticosteroidsInfectionsDiseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or allergyLeukemiaSevere emotional or physical stressTissue damage (such as from burns or a heart attack) A high platelet count may be due to:BleedingDiseases such as cancer or blood diseaseIron deficiencyProblems with the bone marrow A low platelet count may be due to:Disorders where platelets are destroyedPregnancyEnlarged spleenBone marrow failure (for example, due to infection, tumor, radiation, or fibrosis)Chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancer Risks

There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:Excessive bleedingFainting or feeling lightheadedHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Considerations

RBCs transport hemoglobin which, in turn, carries oxygen. The amount of oxygen received by body tissues depends on the amount and function of RBCs and hemoglobin.WBCs are mediators of inflammation and the immune response. There are various types of WBCs that normally appear in the blood:Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes)Band cells (slightly immature neutrophils)T-type lymphocytes (T cells)B-type lymphocytes (B cells)MonocytesEosinophilsBasophilsAlternative Names

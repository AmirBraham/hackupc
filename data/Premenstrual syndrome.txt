Women with PMS may also respond differently to these hormones.PMS may be related to social, cultural, biological, and psychological factors.Most women experience PMS symptoms during their childbearing years. PMS occurs more often in women:Between their late 20s and 40sWho have had at least one childWith a personal or family history of major depressionWith a history of postpartum depression or an affective mood disorderThe symptoms often get worse in late 30s and 40s as menopause approaches.Symptoms

 Acute cholecystitis is sudden swelling and irritation of the gallbladder. It causes severe belly pain. Causes

The gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which is produced in the liver. Your body uses bile to digest fats in the small intestine. Acute cholecystitis occurs when bile becomes trapped in the gallbladder. This often happens because a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile travels into and out of the gallbladder. When a stone blocks this duct, bile builds up, causing irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to swelling and infection.Other causes include:Serious illnesses, such as HIV or diabetesTumors of the gallbladder (rare) Some people are more at risk for gallstones. Risk factors include:Being femalePregnancyHormone therapyOlder ageBeing Native American or HispanicObesityLosing or gaining weight rapidlyDiabetes Sometimes, the bile duct becomes blocked temporarily. When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to long-term (chronic) cholecystitis. This is swelling and irritation that continues over time. Eventually, the gallbladder becomes thick and hard. It does not store and release bile as well as it did. Symptoms

The main symptom is pain in the upper right side or upper middle of your belly that usually lasts at least 30 minutes. You may feel:Sharp, cramping, or dull painSteady painPain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade Other symptoms that may occur include:Clay-colored stoolsFeverNausea and vomitingYellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Exams and Tests

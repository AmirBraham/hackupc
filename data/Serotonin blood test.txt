Serotonin is a chemical produced by nerve cells.This test is usually done when carcinoid syndrome is suspected. Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms associated with carcinoid tumors.

The normal range is 50 to 200 ng/mL (0.28 to 1.14 Âµmol/L).Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

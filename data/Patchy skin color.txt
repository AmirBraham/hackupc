 Patchy skin color is areas where the skin color is irregular with lighter or darker areas. Mottling or mottled skin refers to blood vessel changes in the skin that cause a patchy appearance.Considerations

Irregular or patchy discoloration of the skin can be caused by:Changes in melanin, a substance produced in the skin cells that gives skin its colorGrowth of bacteria or other organisms on the skinBlood vessel (vascular) changes Inflammation due to certain rashesThe following can increase or decrease melanin production:Your genesHeatInjuryExposure to radiation (such as from the sun)Exposure to heavy metalsChanges in hormone levels Certain conditions such as vitiligo 
 Certain fungal infectionsCertain rashesExposure to sun or ultraviolet (UV) light, especially after taking a medicine called psoralens, may increase skin color (pigmentation). Increased pigment production is called hyperpigmentation, and can result from certain rashes as well as sun exposure.Decreased pigment production is called hypopigmentation.Skin color changes can be their own condition, or they may be caused by other medical conditions or disorders.How much skin pigmentation you have can help determine which skin diseases you may be more likely to develop. For example, lighter-skinned people are more sensitive to sun exposure and damage. This raises the risk of skin cancers. But even in darker-skinned people, too much sun exposure can lead to skin cancers.Examples of the most common skin cancers are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.Generally, skin color changes are cosmetic and do not affect physical health. But, mental stress can occur because of pigment changes. Some pigment changes may be a sign that you are at risk for other medical problems.Causes

Causes of pigment changes may include any of the following:Acanthosis nigricansAcneCafe-au-lait spotsCuts, scrapes, wounds, insect bites and minor skin infectionsErythrasmaMelasma (chloasma)MelanomaMoles (nevi), bathing trunk nevi, or giant neviDermal melanocytosisPityriasis albaRadiation therapyRashesSensitivity to the sun due to medicine reactions or certain drugsSunburn or suntanTinea versicolorUnevenly applying sunscreen, leading to areas of burn, tan, and no tanVitiligoHome Care

In some cases, normal skin color returns on its own.You may use medicated creams that bleach or lighten the skin to reduce discoloration or to even the skin tone where hyperpigmented areas are large or very noticeable. Check with your dermatologist first about using such products. Follow the instructions on the package about how to use such products.Selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue), ketoconazole, or tolnaftate (Tinactin) lotion can help treat tinea versicolor, which is a fungal infection that can appear as hypopigmented patches. Apply as directed to the affected area daily until the discolored patches disappear. Tinea versicolor often returns, even with treatment.You may use cosmetics or skin dyes to hide skin color changes. Makeup can also help hide mottled skin, but it will not cure the problem.Avoid too much sun exposure and use sunblock with an SPF of at least 30. Hypopigmented skin sunburns easily, and hyperpigmented skin may get even darker. In darker-skinned people, skin damage may cause permanent hyperpigmentation.When to Contact a Medical Professional

You will also be asked about your skin symptoms, such as when you first noticed your skin color change, if it started suddenly, and if you had any skin injuries.Tests that may be done include:Scrapings of skin lesions

 Secondary systemic amyloidosis is a disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits.Secondary means it occurs because of another disease or situation. For example, this condition usually occurs due to long-term (chronic) infection or inflammation. In contrast, primary amyloidosis means there is no other disease that is causing the condition.Systemic means that the disease affects the entire body.Causes

The exact cause of secondary systemic amyloidosis is unknown. You are more likely to develop secondary systemic amyloidosis if you have a long-term infection or inflammation.This condition may occur with:Ankylosing spondylitis -- a form of arthritis that mostly affects the bones and joints in the spineBronchiectasis -- a disease in which the large airways in the lungs are damaged by chronic infectionChronic osteomyelitis -- a long-standing bone infectionCystic fibrosis -- a genetic disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body, leading to chronic infection of the lungsFamilial Mediterranean fever -- an inherited disorder of repeated fevers and inflammation that often affects the lining of the abdomen, chest, or jointsGoutHairy cell leukemia -- a type of blood cancerHodgkin disease -- cancer of the lymph tissueInflammatory bowel diseaseJuvenile idiopathic arthritis -- arthritis that affects childrenMultiple myeloma -- a type of blood cancerPsoriatic arthritisReactive arthritis -- a group of conditions that causes swelling and inflammation of the joints, eyes, and urinary and genital systems)Rheumatoid arthritisSystemic lupus erythematosus -- an autoimmune disorderTuberculosisVasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels)Symptoms

Symptoms of secondary systemic amyloidosis depend on which body tissue is affected by the protein deposits. These deposits damage normal tissues. This may lead to the symptoms or signs of this illness, including:Bleeding in the skinFatigueIrregular heartbeatNumbness of hands and feetRashShortness of breathSwallowing difficultiesSwollen arms or legsSwollen tongueWeak hand gripWeight loss Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.Tests that may be done include:Abdominal ultrasound (may show a swollen liver or spleen)Biopsy (removing a small piece) or aspiration using a needle to remove a small piece of fat just beneath the skin Biopsy of rectumBiopsy of skinBiopsy of bone marrowBlood tests, including creatinine and BUN (blood urea nitrogen)
   EchocardiogramElectrocardiogram (ECG)
   Nerve conduction velocityUrinalysisTreatment

The condition that is causing the amyloidosis should be treated. In some cases, the drug colchicine or an immunosuppressive drug (medicine that suppresses the immune system) is prescribed. Outlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on which organs are affected. It also depends on, whether the disease that is causing it can be controlled. If the disease involves the heart and kidneys, it may lead to organ failure and death.Possible Complications

Health problems that may result from secondary systemic amyloidosis include:Endocrine failureHeart failureKidney failureNerve damageRespiratory failure When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Friedreich ataxia is a rare disease passed down through families (inherited). It affects the muscles and heart.Causes

Friedreich ataxia is caused by a defect in a gene called frataxin (FXN). Changes in this gene cause the body to make too much of a part of DNA called trinucleotide repeat (GAA). Normally, the body contains about 8 to 30 copies of GAA. People with Friedreich ataxia have as many as 1,000 copies. The more copies of GAA a person has, the earlier in life the disease starts and the faster it gets worse.Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means you must get a copy of the defective gene from both your mother and father.Symptoms

Symptoms are caused by the wearing away of structures in areas of the brain and spinal cord that control coordination, muscle movement, and other functions. Symptoms most often begin before puberty. Symptoms may include:Abnormal speechChanges in vision, particularly color visionDecrease in ability to feel vibrations in lower limbsFoot problems, such as hammer toe and high archesHearing loss, this occurs in about 10% of peopleJerky eye movementsLoss of coordination and balance, which leads to frequent fallsMuscle weaknessNo reflexes in the legsUnsteady gait and uncoordinated movements (ataxia), which gets worse with time Muscle problems lead to changes in the spine. This may result in scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis.Heart disease most often develops and may lead to heart failure. Heart failure or dysrhythmias that do not respond to treatment may result in death. Diabetes may develop in later stages of the disease.Exams and Tests

The following tests may be done:ECGElectrophysiological studiesEMG (electromyography)Genetic testingNerve conduction testsMuscle biopsyX-ray, CT scan, or MRI of the headX-ray of the chestX-ray of the spineBlood sugar (glucose) tests may show diabetes or glucose intolerance. An eye exam may show damage to the optic nerve, which most often occurs without symptoms.Treatment

Treatment for Friedreich ataxia includes:CounselingSpeech therapyPhysical therapyWalking aids or wheelchairs Orthopedic devices (braces) may be needed for scoliosis and foot problems. Treating heart disease and diabetes help people live longer and improve their quality of life. Outlook (Prognosis)

Friedreich ataxia slowly gets worse and causes problems doing everyday activities. Most people need to use a wheelchair within 15 years of the disease's start. The disease may lead to early death.Possible Complications

Complications may include:DiabetesHeart failure or heart diseaseLoss of ability to move around When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if symptoms of Friedreich ataxia occur, especially if there is a family history of the disorder.Prevention

People with a family history of Friedreich ataxia who intend to have children may want to consider genetic screening to determine their risk.Alternative Names

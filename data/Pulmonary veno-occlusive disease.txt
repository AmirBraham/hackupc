 Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a very rare disease. It leads to high blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension).Causes

In most cases, the cause of PVOD is unknown. The high blood pressure occurs in the pulmonary arteries. These lung arteries are directly connected to the right side of the heart.The condition may be related to a viral infection. It may occur as a complication of certain diseases such as lupus, or bone marrow transplantation.The disorder is most common among children and young adults. As the disease gets worse, it causes:Narrowed pulmonary veinsPulmonary artery hypertensionCongestion and swelling of the lungsPossible risk factors for PVOD include:Family history of the conditionSmokingExposure to substances like trichloroethylene or chemotherapy medicinesSystemic sclerosis (autoimmune skin disorder)Symptoms

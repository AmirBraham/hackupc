 Fish tapeworm infection is an intestinal infection with a parasite found in fish.Causes

The fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum) is the largest parasite that infects humans. Humans become infected when they eat raw or undercooked freshwater fish that contain fish tapeworm cysts.The infection is seen in many areas where humans eat uncooked or undercooked freshwater fish from rivers or lakes, including:
 Africa
 
 Eastern Europe
 
 North and South America
 
 Scandinavia
 
 Some Asian countries
 After a person has eaten infected fish, the worm larva begins to grow in the intestine. Larvae are fully grown in 3 to 6 weeks. The adult worm, which is segmented, attaches to the wall of the intestine. The tapeworm may reach a length of 30 feet (9 meters). Eggs are formed in each segment of the worm and are passed in the stool. Sometimes, parts of the worm may also be passed in the stool.The tapeworm absorbs the nutrition from food that the infected person eats. This may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia.Symptoms

Most people who are infected have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they may include:Abdominal discomfort or painDiarrheaWeaknessWeight lossExams and Tests

People who are infected sometimes pass segments of worm in their stools. These segments can be seen in the stool.Tests may include:Complete blood count, including differentialBlood tests to determine the cause of anemia, if presentVitamin B12 levelStool exam for worm eggs and parasites Treatment

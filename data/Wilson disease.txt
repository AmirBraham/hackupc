 Wilson disease is an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues. The excess copper damages the liver and nervous system. Causes

Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder. If both parents carry a defective gene for Wilson disease, there is a 25% chance in each pregnancy that the child will have the disorder.Wilson disease causes the body to take in and keep too much copper. The copper deposits in the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. This causes tissue damage, tissue death, and scarring. The affected organs stop working normally.This condition is most common in eastern Europeans, Sicilians, and southern Italians, but it may occur in any group. Wilson disease symptoms typically appears in people under 40 years old. In children, the symptoms begin to show by age 4.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Abnormal posture of arms and legsArthritisConfusion or deliriumDementiaDifficulty moving arms and legs, stiffnessDifficulty walking (ataxia)Emotional or behavioral changesEnlargement of the abdomen due to accumulation of fluid (ascites)Personality changesPhobiasSlow movementsSlow or decreased movement and expressions of the faceSpeech impairmentTremors of the arms or handsUncontrollable movementUnpredictable and jerky movementVomiting bloodWeaknessYellow skin (jaundice) or yellow color of the white of the eye (icterus)Exams and Tests

A slit-lamp eye exam may show:Limited eye movementRusty or brown-colored ring around the iris (Kayser-Fleischer rings)A physical exam may show signs of:Damage to the central nervous system, including loss of coordination, loss of muscle control, muscle tremors, loss of thinking and IQ, loss of memory, and confusion (delirium or dementia)Liver or spleen disorders (including hepatomegaly and splenomegaly)Lab tests may include:Complete blood count (CBC)Serum ceruloplasminSerum copperSerum uric acidUrine copperIf there are liver problems, lab tests may find:High AST and ALTHigh bilirubinHigh PT and PTTLow blood albuminOther tests may include:24-hour urine copper testAbdominal x-rayAbdominal MRICT scan of the abdomenHead CT scanHead MRILiver biopsyUpper GI endoscopyThe gene that causes Wilson disease has been found. It is called ATP7B. DNA testing is available for this gene. Talk to your health care provider or a genetic counselor to learn if you should have gene testing performed.Treatment

The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the tissues. This is done by a procedure called chelation. Certain medicines are given that bind to copper and help remove it through the kidneys or gut. Treatment must be lifelong.The following medicines may be used:Penicillamine (such as Cuprimine, Depen) binds to copper and leads to increased release of copper in the urine.Trientine (such as Syprine) binds (chelates) the copper and increases its release through the urine.Zinc acetate (such as Galzin) blocks copper from being absorbed in the intestinal tract. Vitamin E supplements may also be used.Sometimes, medicines that chelate copper (such as penicillamine) can affect the function of the brain and nervous system (neurological function). Other medicines under investigation may bind copper without affecting neurological function.A low-copper diet may also be recommended. Foods to avoid include:ChocolateDried fruitLiverMushroomsNutsShellfishYou may want to drink distilled water because some tap water flows through copper pipes. Avoid using copper cooking utensils.Symptoms may be managed with exercise or physical therapy. People who are confused or unable to care for themselves may need special protective measures.A liver transplant may be considered in cases where the liver is severely damaged by the disease.Support Groups

Lifelong treatment is needed to control Wilson disease. The disorder may cause fatal effects, such as loss of liver function. Copper can have toxic effects on the nervous system. In cases where the disorder is not fatal, symptoms may be disabling.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Anemia (hemolytic anemia is rare)Central nervous system complicationsCirrhosisDeath of liver tissuesFatty liverHepatitisIncreased chances of bone fracturesIncreased number of infectionsInjury caused by fallsJaundiceJoint contractures or other deformityLoss of ability to care for selfLoss of ability to function at work and homeLoss of ability to interact with other peopleLoss of muscle mass (muscle atrophy)Psychological complicationsSide effects of penicillamine and other medicines used to treat the disorderSpleen problems Liver failure and damage to the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord) are the most common and dangerous effects of the disorder. If the disease is not caught and treated early, it can be fatal.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of Wilson disease. Contact a genetic counselor if you have a history of Wilson disease in your family and you are planning to have children.Prevention

Genetic counseling is recommended for people with a family history of Wilson disease.Alternative Names

 Pulmonary aspergilloma is a mass caused by a fungal infection. It usually grows in lung cavities. The infection can also appear in the brain, kidney, or other organs.Causes

Aspergillosis is an infection caused by the fungus aspergillus. Aspergillomas are formed when the fungus grows in a clump in a lung cavity. The cavity is often created by a previous condition. Cavities in the lung may be caused by diseases such as:TuberculosisCoccidioidomycosisCystic fibrosisHistoplasmosis 
 Lung abscess 
  
 Lung cancer 
 SarcoidosisThe most common species of fungus that causes disease in humans is Aspergillus fumigatus. 
 Aspergillus is a common fungus. It grows on dead leaves, stored grain, bird droppings, compost piles, and other decaying vegetation.Symptoms

You may not have symptoms. When symptoms do develop, they can include:Chest painCoughCoughing up blood, which can be a life-threatening signFatigueFeverUnintentional weight lossExams and Tests

Your health care provider may suspect you have a fungal infection after x-rays of your lungs show the ball of fungus. Other tests that may be done include:Biopsy of lung tissueBlood test for presence of aspergillus in the body (galactomannan)Blood test to detect immune response to aspergillus (specific antibodies for aspergillus)Bronchoscopy or bronchoscopy with lavageChest CTSputum cultureTreatment

Many people never develop symptoms. Often, no treatment is needed, unless you are coughing up blood.Sometimes, antifungal medicines may be used.If you have bleeding in the lungs, your provider may recommend a test to inject dye into the blood vessels (angiography) to find the site of bleeding. The bleeding is stopped by either:Surgery to remove the aspergillomaProcedure that inserts material into the blood vessels to stop the bleeding (embolization)
   Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome can be good in many people. However, it depends on the severity of the condition and your overall health.Surgery may be very successful in some cases, but it is complex and can have a high risk of serious complications.Possible Complications

Complications of pulmonary aspergilloma may include:Difficulty breathing that gets worseMassive bleeding from the lungSpread of the infectionWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

See your provider if you cough up blood, and be sure to mention any other symptoms that have developed.Prevention

People who have had related lung infections or who have weakened immune systems should try to avoid environments where the aspergillus fungus is found.Alternative Names

 Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare disorder that is present at birth. A child with this condition will have a port-wine stain birthmark (usually on the face) and may have nervous system problems.Causes


In many people, the cause of Sturge-Weber is due to a mutation of the GNAQ gene. This gene affects small blood vessels called capillaries in some but not all body cells. Problems in the capillaries cause the port-wine stains to form.Sturge-Weber is not thought to be passed down (inherited) through families.Symptoms

Symptoms of SWS include:Port-wine stain (more common on the upper face and eye-lid than the rest of the body)SeizuresHeadacheParalysis or weakness on one sideLearning disabilitiesGlaucoma (very high fluid pressure in the eye)Low thyroid (hypothyroidism) Exams and Tests

 
 The health care provider should check all birthmarks, including a port-wine stain.Glaucoma may be one sign of the condition.Tests may include:CT scanMRI scanX-raysTreatment

Treatment is based on the person's signs and symptoms, and may include:Anticonvulsant medicines for seizuresEye drops or surgery to treat glaucomaLaser therapy for port-wine stainsPhysical therapy for paralysis or weaknessPossible brain surgery to prevent seizuresSupport Groups

>Outlook (Prognosis)

SWS is usually not life threatening. The condition does need regular lifelong follow-up. The person's quality of life depends on how well their symptoms (such as seizures) can be prevented or treated.The person will need to visit an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) at least once a year to treat glaucoma. They also will need to see a neurologist to treat seizures and other nervous system symptoms.Possible Complications

These complications can occur:Abnormal blood vessel growth in the skullContinued growth of the port-wine stainDevelopmental delaysEmotional and behavioral problemsGlaucoma, which may lead to blindnessParalysisSeizuresWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Seizures, vision problems, paralysis, and changes in alertness or mental state may mean the coverings of the brain are involved. These symptoms should be evaluated right away.Prevention

There is no known prevention.Alternative Names

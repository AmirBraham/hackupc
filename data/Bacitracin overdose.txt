If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.Poisonous Ingredient

Bacitracin can be poisonous in large amounts.Where Found

Bacitracin is found in certain over-the-counter antibiotic ointments such as Neosporin. It may also be found in some prescription eye ointments.The medicine also comes in a form that can be given as a shot into a muscle or through a vein. Using it this way is the most common way for an overdose to occur.Symptoms

Bacitracin is very safe. However, getting it in the eyes may cause redness and some pain and itching.Eating bacitracin in large amounts may cause stomach pain and vomiting.In rare cases, bacitracin can cause an allergic reaction, often redness and itching of the skin. If the reaction is severe, there may be difficulty swallowing or breathing.Bacitracin is still used as a body-wide (systemic) antibiotic in parts of the world. If it is given by injection, it may cause pain in the area of the shot or a skin rash. It can also cause nausea, vomiting, and bone marrow and kidney failure.People who are sensitive to neomycin, another antibiotic that is used on the skin, may also be sensitive to bacitracin.Home Care

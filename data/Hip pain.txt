 Hip pain involves any pain in or around the hip joint. You may not feel pain from your hip directly over the hip area. You may feel it in your groin or pain in your thigh or knee. Causes

Hip pain may be caused by problems in the bones or cartilage of your hip, including: Hip fractures -- can cause sudden and acute hip pain. These injuries can be serious and lead to major problems. It is more common in older patients because their bones can be weaker.Infection in the bones or joints.Osteonecrosis of the hip (necrosis from loss of blood supply to the bone).Arthritis -- often felt in the front part of the thigh or groin.Labral tear of the hip.Femoral acetabular impingement -- abnormal growth around your hip that is a precursor to hip arthritis. It can cause pain with movement and exercise. Pain in or around the hip may also be caused by problems such as:Bursitis -- pain when getting up from a chair, walking, climbing stairs, and drivingHamstring strainIliotibial band syndromeHip flexor strainHip impingement syndromeGroin strainSnapping hip syndrome Pain you feel in the hip may reflect a problem in your back, rather than in the hip itself.

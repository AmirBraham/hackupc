 Niacin is a type of B vitamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. It is not stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins, but they have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.Function

Niacin helps the digestive system, skin, and nerves to function. It is also important for changing food to energy.Food Sources

REFERENCE INTAKESRecommendations for niacin and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), which are developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is the term for a set of reference values that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people.Adequate Intake (AI): when there is not enough evidence to develop an RDA, the AI is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition. Dietary Reference Intakes for niacin:Infants (AI)0 to 6 months: 2 milligrams per day (mg/day)7 to 12 months: 4 mg/dayChildren (RDA)1 to 3 years: 6 mg/day4 to 8 years: 8 mg/day9 to 13 years: 12 mg/day Adolescents and Adults (RDA)Males age 14 and older: 16 mg/dayFemales age 14 and older: 14 mg/day, 18 mg/day during pregnancy, 17 mg/day during lactation Specific recommendations depend on age, sex, and other factors (such as pregnancy). Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need higher amounts. Ask your provider which amount is best for you.The best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods.Alternative Names

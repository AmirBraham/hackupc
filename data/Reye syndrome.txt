 Reye syndrome is characterized by sudden (acute) brain damage and liver function problems. This condition does not have a known cause.This syndrome has occurred in children who were given aspirin when they had chickenpox or the flu. Reye syndrome has become very rare. This is because aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in children.Causes

Never give a child aspirin unless told to do so by your child's provider.When a child must take aspirin for a medical condition, take care to reduce the child's risk of catching a viral illness, such as the flu and chickenpox. Avoid aspirin for several weeks after the child has received a varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.Note: Other over-the-counter medicines, such as Pepto-Bismol and substances with oil of wintergreen also contain aspirin compounds called salicylates. DO NOT give these to a child who has a cold or fever.Alternative Names

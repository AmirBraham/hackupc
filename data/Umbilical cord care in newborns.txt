 When your baby is born, the umbilical cord is cut and there is a stump left. The stump should dry and fall off by the time your baby is 5 to 15 days old. Keep the stump clean with gauze and water only. Sponge bathe the rest of your baby, as well. Do not put your baby in a tub of water until the stump has fallen off.Let the stump fall off naturally. Do not try to pull it off, even if it is only hanging on by a thread.Watch the umbilical cord stump for infection. This does not occur often. But if it does, the infection can spread quickly.Signs of a local infection at the stump include:Foul-smelling, yellow drainage from the stumpRedness, swelling, or tenderness of the skin around the stump Be aware of signs of a more serious infection. Contact your baby's health care provider immediately if your baby has:Poor feedingFever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higherLethargyFloppy, poor muscle tone If the cord stump is pulled off too soon, it could start actively bleeding, meaning every time you wipe away a drop of blood, another drop appears. If the cord stump continues to bleed, contact your baby's provider immediately.Sometimes, instead of completely drying, the cord will form pink scar tissue called a granuloma. The granuloma drains a light-yellowish fluid. This will most often go away in about a week. If it does not, contact your baby's provider.If your baby's stump has not fallen off in 4 weeks (and more likely much sooner), contact your baby's provider. There may be a problem with the baby's anatomy or immune system.Alternative Names

 Aspergillosis is an infection or allergic response due to the aspergillus fungus.Causes

Aspergillosis is caused by a fungus called aspergillus. The fungus is often found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation. It can also be found on marijuana leaves.Although most people are often exposed to aspergillus, infections caused by the fungus rarely occur in people who have a healthy immune system.There are several forms of aspergillosis:Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to the fungus. This infection usually develops in people who already have lung problems such as asthma or cystic fibrosis.Aspergilloma is a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung scarring such as tuberculosis or lung abscess.Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious infection with pneumonia. It can spread to other parts of the body. This infection occurs most often in people with a weakened immune system. This can be from cancer, AIDS, leukemia, an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medicines that lower the number or function of white blood cells or weaken the immune system. Symptoms

Symptoms depend on the type of infection.Symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may include:CoughCoughing up blood or brownish mucus plugsFeverGeneral ill feeling (malaise)WheezingWeight loss Other symptoms depend on the part of the body affected, and may include:Bone painChest painChillsDecreased urine outputHeadachesIncreased phlegm production, which may be bloodyShortness of breathSkin sores (lesions)Vision problems Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms.Tests to diagnose aspergillus infection include:Aspergillus antibody testChest x-rayComplete blood countCT scanGalactomannan (a sugar molecule shed from the fungus that is sometimes found in the blood)Immunoglobulin E (IgE) blood levelLung function testsSputum stain and culture for fungus (looking for aspergillus)Tissue biopsyTreatment

A fungus ball is usually not treated with antifungal medicines unless there is bleeding into the lung tissue. In such a case, surgery and medicines are needed.Invasive aspergillosis is treated with several weeks of an antifungal medicine. It can be given by mouth or IV (into a vein). Endocarditis caused by aspergillus is treated by surgically replacing the infected heart valves. Long-term antifungal medicines are also needed.Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is treated with medicines that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive medicines), such as prednisone, typically in conjunction with antifungals.Outlook (Prognosis)

With treatment, people with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis usually get better over time. It is common for the disease to come back (relapse) and need repeat treatment.If invasive aspergillosis does not get better with treatment using medicine, it eventually leads to death. The outlook for invasive aspergillosis also depends on the person's underlying disease and immune system health.Possible Complications

Health problems from the disease or treatment include:Amphotericin B can cause kidney damage and unpleasant side effects such as fever and chillsBronchiectasis (permanent scarring and enlargement of the small sacs in the lungs)Invasive lung disease can cause massive bleeding from the lungMucus plugs in the airwaysPermanent airway blockageRespiratory failureWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of aspergillosis or if you have a weakened immune system and develop a fever.Prevention

Precautions should be taken when using medicines that suppress the immune system.Alternative Names

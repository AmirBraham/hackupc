 Decorticate posture is an abnormal posturing in which a person is stiff with bent arms, clenched fists, and legs held out straight. The arms are bent in toward the body and the wrists and fingers are bent and held on the chest.This type of posturing is a sign of severe damage in the brain. People who have this condition should get medical attention right away.Considerations

Decorticate posture is a sign of damage to the nerve pathway in the midbrain, which is between the brain and spinal cord. The midbrain controls motor movement and many other important functions. Although decorticate posture is serious, it is usually not as serious as a type of abnormal posture called decerebrate posture.The posturing may occur on one or both sides of the body.Causes

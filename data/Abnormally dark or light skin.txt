 Abnormally dark or light skin is skin that has turned darker or lighter than normal.Considerations

Normal skin contains cells called melanocytes. These cells produce melanin, the substance that gives skin its color.Skin with too much melanin is called hyperpigmented skin.Skin with too little melanin is called hypopigmented. Skin with no melanin at all is called depigmented.Pale skin areas are due to too little melanin or underactive melanocytes. Darker areas of skin (or an area that tans more easily) occurs when you have more melanin or overactive melanocytes.Bronzing of the skin may sometimes be mistaken for a suntan. This skin discoloration often develops slowly, starting at the elbows, knuckles, and knees and spreading from there. Bronzing may also be seen on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. The bronze color can range from light to dark (in fair-skinned people) with the degree of darkness due to the underlying cause.Causes

Causes of hyperpigmentation include:Skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation)Use of certain drugs (such as minocycline, certain cancer chemotherapies, and birth control pills)Hormone system diseases such as Addison diseaseHemochromatosis (iron overload)Sun exposurePregnancy (melasma, or mask of pregnancy) Certain birthmarksSkin condition called acanthosis nigricansCauses of hypopigmentation include:Skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hypopigmentation)Certain fungal infections (such as tinea versicolor)Pityriasis albaVitiligoCertain medicinesSkin condition called idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis in sun exposed areas such as the arms Certain birthmarksHome Care

Over-the-counter and prescription creams are available for lightening the skin. Hydroquinone combined with tretinoin is an effective combination. If you use these creams, follow instructions carefully, and don't use one for more than 3 weeks at a time. Darker skin requires greater care when using these preparations. Cosmetics may also help mask a discoloration.Avoid too much sun exposure. Always use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.Abnormally dark skin may continue even after treatment.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Insecticide is any chemical that kills bugs. Insecticide poisoning occurs when someone swallows or breathes in an insecticide or it is absorbed through the skin.This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.Poisonous Ingredient

Most household bug sprays contain plant-derived chemicals called pyrethrins. These chemicals were originally isolated from chrysanthemum flowers and are generally not harmful. However, they can cause life-threatening breathing problems if they are breathed in.Stronger insecticides, which a farm or commercial greenhouse might use or someone might store in their garage, contain many dangerous substances. These include:CarbamatesOrganophosphatesParadichlorobenzenes (mothballs)Where Found

Various insecticides contain these chemicals.Symptoms

Below are symptoms of insecticide poisoning in different parts of the body.Symptoms of pyrethrin poisoning:LUNGS AND AIRWAYSBreathing difficulty NERVOUS SYSTEMComa (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness)SeizuresSKINIrritationRedness or swelling Symptoms of organophosphate or carbamate poisoning:HEART AND BLOODSlow heart rate LUNGS AND AIRWAYSBreathing difficultyWheezingNERVOUS SYSTEMAnxiety
   Coma (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness)
   Seizures
   DizzinessHeadacheWeaknessBLADDER AND KIDNEYSIncreased urination EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROATDrooling from increased salivaIncreased tears in the eyesSmall pupils STOMACH AND INTESTINESAbdominal crampsDiarrheaLoss of appetiteNausea and vomitingSKINBlue-colored lips and fingernailsNote: Serious poisoning can occur if an organophosphate gets on your bare skin or if you don't wash your skin soon after it gets on you. Large amounts of the chemical soak through the skin unless you are protected. Life-threatening paralysis and death can occur very quickly.Symptoms of paradichlorobenzene poisoning:EYES, EARS, THROAT, AND MOUTHBurning in mouthLUNGS AND AIRWAYSBreathing problems (rapid, slow, or painful)CoughShallow breathingMUSCLESMuscle spasmsNERVOUS SYSTEMChanges in alertnessHeadacheSlurred speechWeaknessSKINYellow skin (jaundice)STOMACH AND INTESTINESDiarrheaAbdominal painNausea and vomitingNote: Paradichlorobenzene mothballs are not very toxic. They have replaced the more toxic camphor and naphthalene types.Home Care

Get medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.If the person breathed in the poison, move them to fresh air right away.Before Calling Emergency

Have this information ready:Person's age, weight, and conditionName of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)Time it was swallowedAmount swallowedPoison Control

Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.What to Expect at the Emergency Room

Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.Tests that may be done include:Blood and urine testsBronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungsChest x-rayElectrocardiogram (ECG)Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomachTreatment may include:Fluids by IV (through a vein)Medicines to counteract the poisonous effects, such as atropineMedicines to support the blood pressure or heart rateMedicine to treat symptomsTube through the mouth into the stomach to empty the stomach (gastric lavage)Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several daysSurgery to remove burned skinBreathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator)Outlook (Prognosis)

How well someone does depends on how severe the poisoning is and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Swallowing these poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body.It is a good sign that recovery will occur if the person continues to improve in the first 4 to 6 hours after they receive treatment.Although the symptoms are the same for carbamate and organophosphate poisoning, it is harder to recover after organophosphate poisoning.Alternative Names

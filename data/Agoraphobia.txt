The goal of treatment is to help you feel and function better. The success of treatment usually depends in part on how severe the agoraphobia is. Treatment most often combines talk therapy with a medicine. Certain medicines, often also used to treat depression, may be helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. DO NOT stop taking them or change the dosage without talking with your provider.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are most often the first choice of antidepressant.Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are another choice. Other medicines used to treat depression or medicines used to treat seizures may also be tried.Medicines called sedatives or hypnotics may also be prescribed.These medicines should only be taken under a health care provider's direction.Your provider will prescribe a limited amount of these drugs. They should not to be used every day.They may be used when symptoms become very severe or when you are about to be exposed to something that always brings on your symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy. It involves 10 to 20 visits with a mental health professional over several weeks. CBT helps you change the thoughts that cause your condition. It may involve:Understanding and controlling distorted feelings or views of stressful events or situationsLearning stress management and relaxation techniquesRelaxing, then imagining the things that cause the anxiety, working from the least fearful to the most fearful (called systematic desensitization and exposure therapy) You may also be slowly exposed to the real-life situation that causes the fear to help you overcome it.A healthy lifestyle that includes exercise, getting enough rest, and good nutrition can also be helpful.Support Groups

You can ease the stress of having agoraphobia by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.Support groups are usually not a good substitute for talk therapy or taking medicine, but can be a helpful addition.See below for more information and support for people with agoraphobia:Anxiety and Depression Association of America -- adaa.org/supportgroupsOutlook (Prognosis)

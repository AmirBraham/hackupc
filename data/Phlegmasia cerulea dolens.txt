 Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is an uncommon, severe form of deep venous thrombosis (blood clots in the vein). It most often occurs in the upper leg.Causes

Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is preceded by a condition called phlegmasia alba dolens. This occurs when the leg is swollen and white due to a clot in a deep vein that blocks blood flow.Symptoms

Severe pain, rapid swelling, and bluish-skin coloring affect the area below the blocked vein.Possible Complications

Continued clotting can lead to increased swelling. The swelling can interfere with blood flow. This complication is called phlegmasia alba dolens. It causes the skin to turn white. Phlegmasia alba dolens may lead to tissue death (gangrene) and the need for amputation.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Seek medical help right awayÂ if an arm or leg is severely swollen, blue, or painful.Alternative Names

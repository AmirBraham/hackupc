 Webbing of the fingers or toes is called syndactyly. It refers to the connection of 2 or more fingers or toes. Most of the time, the areas are connected only by skin. In rare cases, the bones may fuse together.Considerations

Syndactyly is often found during a child's health exam. In its most common form, webbing occurs between the 2nd and 3rd toes. This form is often inherited and is not unusual. Syndactyly can also occur along with other birth defects involving the skull, face, and bones.The web connections most often go up to the first joint of the finger or toe. However, they can run the length of the finger or toe."Polysyndactyly" describes both webbing and the presence of an extra number of fingers or toes.Causes

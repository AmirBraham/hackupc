 An abdominal wall fat pad biopsy is the removal of a small part of the abdominal wall fat pad for laboratory study of the tissue.How the Test is Performed

Needle aspiration is the most common method of taking an abdominal wall fat pad biopsy. The health care provider cleans the skin on your belly area. Numbing medicine will be applied on or injected into the area. A needle is placed through the skin and into the fat pad under the skin. A small piece of the fat pad is removed with the needle. It is sent to a laboratory for analysis.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is usually necessary. However, follow any specific instructions your provider gives you.How the Test will Feel

You may have some mild discomfort or feel pressure when the needle is inserted. Afterward, the area may feel tender or be bruised for several days.Why the Test is Performed

The procedure is done most often to test for amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs, impairing their function. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits.Diagnosing the disease in this way may avoid the need for a biopsy of a nerve or an internal organ, which is a more difficult procedure.Normal Results

The fat pad tissues are normal.What Abnormal Results Mean

In the case of amyloidosis, abnormal results mean there are amyloid deposits.Risks

There is a slight risk for infection, bruising, or slight bleeding.Alternative Names

Amyloidosis - abdominal wall fat pad biopsy; Abdominal wall biopsy; Biopsy - abdominal wall fat padImages

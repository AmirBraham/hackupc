Tinnitus is common. Almost everyone notices a mild form of tinnitus once in a while. It usually lasts a few minutes. However, constant or recurring tinnitus may be stressful and may make it harder to focus or sleep.Tinnitus can be:Subjective, which means that the sound is only heard by the personObjective, which means that the sound is heard by both the affected person and the examiner (using a stethoscope near the person's ear, head, or neck)Causes

However, tinnitus can be a symptom of almost any ear problem, including:Ear infectionsForeign objects or wax in the earHearing lossMeniere disease -- an inner ear disorder that involves hearing loss and dizzinessProblem with the eustachian tube (tube that runs between the middle ear and the throat)Antibiotics, aspirin, or other drugs may also cause ear noises. Alcohol, caffeine, or smoking may worsen tinnitus if the person already has it.Sometimes, tinnitus is a sign of high blood pressure, an allergy, or anemia.

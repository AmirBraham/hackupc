 Dementia is loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Dementia may also be referred to as major neurocognitive disorder.Dementia due to metabolic causes is a loss of brain function that can occur with abnormal chemical processes in the body. With some of these disorders, if treated early, brain dysfunction can be reversed. Left untreated, permanent brain damage, such as dementia, can occur.Causes

Possible metabolic causes of dementia include:Hormonal disorders, such as Addison disease, Cushing diseaseHeavy metal exposure, such as to lead, arsenic, mercury, or manganeseRepeat episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), most often seen in people with diabetes who use insulinHigh level of calcium in the blood, such as due to hyperparathyroidism
   Low level of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or high level of thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis) in the bodyLiver cirrhosisKidney failureNutritional disorders, such as vitamin B1 deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, pellagra, or protein-calorie malnutritionPorphyriaPoisons, such as methanolSevere alcohol useWilson diseaseDisorders of the mitochondria (energy-producing parts of cells)Rapid changes in sodium level Symptoms

Metabolic disorders may cause confusion and changes in thinking or reasoning. These changes may be short-term or lasting. Dementia occurs when the symptoms are not reversible. Symptoms can be different for everyone. They depend on the health condition causing the dementia.The early symptoms of dementia can include:Difficulty with tasks that take some thought but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routinesGetting lost on familiar routesLanguage problems, such as trouble with names of familiar objectsLosing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat moodMisplacing itemsPersonality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviorsMood changes that can cause periods of aggression and anxietyPoor performance at work resulting in demotion or loss of jobAs the dementia gets worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of yourself:Changing sleep patterns, often waking up at nightForgetting details about current events, forgetting events in one's life historyHaving difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or drivingHaving hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and behaving violentlyMore difficulty reading or writingPoor judgment and losing the ability to recognize dangerUsing the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentencesWithdrawing from social contactThe person may also have symptoms from the disorder that caused dementia.Exams and Tests

Depending on the cause, a nervous system (neurologic) examination is done to identify the problems.Tests to diagnose a medical condition causing the dementia may include:Ammonia level in the bloodBlood chemistry, electrolytesBlood glucose levelBUN, creatinine to check kidney functionLiver function testsLumbar puncture (spinal tap)Nutritional assessmentThyroid function testsUrinalysisVitamin B12 levelTo rule out certain brain disorders, an EEG (electroencephalogram), head CT scan, or head MRI scan is usually done.Treatment

The aim of treatment is to manage and correct the underlying disorder and control symptoms. With some metabolic disorders, treatment may stop or even reverse the dementia symptoms.Medicines used to treat Alzheimer disease have not been shown to work for these types of disorders. Sometimes, these drugs are used anyway, when other treatments fail to control the underlying problems.Plans should also be made for home care for people with dementia.Outlook (Prognosis)

Outcome varies, depending on the cause of the dementia and the amount of damage to the brain.Possible Complications

Complications may include the following:Loss of ability to function or care for selfLoss of ability to interactPneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infectionsPressure soresSymptoms of the underlying problem (such as loss of sensation due to a nerve injury from vitamin B12 deficiency) When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms get worse or continue. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if there is a sudden change in mental status or a life-threatening emergency.Prevention

Treating the underlying cause may reduce the risk for metabolic dementia.Alternative Names

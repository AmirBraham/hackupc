 Multiple system atrophy- parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is a rare condition that causes symptoms similar to Parkinson disease. However, people with MSA-P have more widespread damage to the part of the nervous system that controls important functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating.The other subtype of MSA is MSA-cerebellar. It mainly affects the cerebellum, an area deep in the brain, just above the spinal cord.Causes

The cause of MSA-P is unknown. The affected areas of the brain overlap with areas affected by Parkinson disease, with similar symptoms. For this reason, this subtype of MSA is called parkinsonian. MSA-P is most often diagnosed in men older than 60. Symptoms

MSA damages the nervous system. The disease tends to progress rapidly. About one half of people with MSA-P have lost most of their motor skills within 5 years of onset of the disease.Symptoms may include:TremorsMovement difficulties, such as slowness, loss of balance, shuffling when walkingFrequent fallsMuscle aches and pains (myalgia), and stiffnessFace changes, such as a masklike appearance to the face and staringDifficulty chewing or swallowing (occasionally), not able to close the mouthDisrupted sleep patterns (often during rapid eye movement [REM] sleep late at night)Dizziness or fainting when standing up or after standing stillErection problemsLoss of control over bowels or bladderProblems with activity that requires small movements (loss of fine motor skills), such as writing that is small and hard to readLoss of sweating in any part of the bodyDecline in mental functionNausea and problems with digestionPosture problems, such as unstable, stooped, or slumped overVision changes, decreased or blurred visionVoice and speech changes Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:ConfusionDementiaDepressionSleep-related breathing difficulties, includingÂ sleep apnea or a blockage in the air passage that leads to a harsh vibrating sound Restless legsExams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine you, and check your eyes, nerves, and muscles. Your blood pressure will be taken while you are lying down and standing up. There are no specific tests to confirm this disease. A doctor who specializes in the nervous system (neurologist) can make the diagnosis based on:History of symptomsPhysical examination resultsRuling out other causes of symptoms Testing to help confirm the diagnosis may include:MRI of headPlasma norepinephrine levelsUrine examination for norepinephrine breakdown products (urine catecholamines) Treatment

There is no cure for MSA-P. There is no known way to prevent the disease from getting worse. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms.Dopaminergic medicines, such as levodopa and carbidopa, may be used to reduce early or mild tremors. But, for many people with MSA-P, these medicines do not work well. Medicines may be used to treat low blood pressure.A pacemaker that is programmed to stimulate the heart to beat at a rapid rate (faster than 100 beats per minute) may increase blood pressure for some people.Constipation can be treated with a high-fiber diet and laxatives. Medicines are available to treat erection problems. Support Groups

More information and support for people with MSA-P and their families can be found at:National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/multiple-system-atrophyThe MSA Coalition -- www.multiplesystematrophy.org/msa-resources/Outlook (Prognosis)

Outcome for MSA is poor. Loss of mental and physical functions slowly get worse. Early death is likely. People typically live 7 to 9 years after diagnosis.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.Contact your provider if you have been diagnosed with MSA and your symptoms return or get worse. Also contact your provider if new symptoms appear, including possible side effects of medicines, such as:Changes in alertness/behavior/moodDelusional behaviorDizzinessHallucinationsInvoluntary movementsLoss of mental functioningNausea or vomitingSevere confusion or disorientation If you have a family member with MSA and their condition declines to the point that you are unable to care for the person at home, seek advice from your family member's provider.Alternative Names

Contact your provider if you have itching that: Is severeDoes not go awayCannot be easily explained Also contact your provider if you have other, unexplained symptoms.With most itching, you do not need to see a provider. Look for an obvious cause of itching at home.It is sometimes easy for a parent to find the cause of a child's itching. Looking closely at the skin will help you identify any bites, stings, rashes, dry skin, or irritation.Have the itching checked out as soon as possible if it keeps returning and does not have a clear cause, you have itching all over your body, or you have hives that keep returning. Unexplained itching may be a symptom of a disease that could be serious.What to Expect at Your Office Visit

Your provider will examine you. You'll also be asked about the itching. Questions may include when it began, how long it has lasted, and whether you have it all the time or only at certain times. You may also be asked about medicines you take, whether you have allergies, or if you have been ill recently.Alternative Names

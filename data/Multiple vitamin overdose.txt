 Multiple vitamin overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of multivitamin supplements. This can be by accident or on purpose.This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an overdose, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.Poisonous Ingredient

Any ingredient in a multiple vitamin supplement can be toxic in large amounts, but the most serious risk comes from iron or calcium.Additional risks are associated with large or toxic doses of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin A.Where Found

Many multivitamin supplements are sold over-the-counter (without a prescription).Symptoms

Iron overdose may include vomiting, diarrhea (which may be bloody or dark), or weakness. People with severe overdoses may develop coma, low blood pressure, liver failure, lung injury, and death.Calcium overdose can impair the functioning of the kidneys, increase the pH of the blood, and can cause nausea and vomiting, confusion or changes in thinking or mentation, itching, and in extreme cases irregular heartbeat.Vitamin D overdose can contribute to high levels of calcium in the blood.Vitamin A overdose can cause nausea and vomiting, dizziness, blurry vision.Additional symptoms of a multivitamin overdose in different parts of the body may include:BLADDER AND KIDNEYSCloudy urineFrequent urinationIncreased urine amount EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROATDry, cracking lips (from chronic overdose)Eye irritationIncreased sensitivity of the eyes to light HEART AND BLOODIrregular heartbeatRapid heartbeat MUSCLES AND JOINTSBone painJoint painMuscle painMuscle weakness NERVOUS SYSTEMConfusion, mood changesConvulsions (seizures)FaintingFatigueHeadacheMental changesIrritability SKIN AND HAIRFlushing (reddened skin) from niacin (vitamin B3)Dry, cracking skinItching, burning skin, or rashYellow-orange areas of skinSensitivity to sun (more likely to sunburn)Hair loss (from long-term overdose) STOMACH AND INTESTINESIntestinal bleeding (from iron)Appetite lossConstipation (from iron or calcium)Diarrhea, possibly bloodyNausea and vomitingStomach painWeight loss (from long-term overdose) Home Care

If medical treatment is quickly received, people who have iron and calcium overdoses usually recover. Overdoses of iron that cause coma or low blood pressure can sometimes be fatal. Iron overdoses can have long-term consequences to the intestines and liver, including intestinal scarring and liver failure.Niacin flush (vitamin B3) is uncomfortable, but lasts only 2 to 8 hours. Vitamins A and D may cause symptoms when large doses are taken each day, but a one large dose of these vitamins is rarely harmful. B vitamins usually do not cause symptoms.Images

  Opioid-based drugs include morphine, oxycodone, and synthetic (man-made) opioid narcotics, such as fentanyl. They are prescribed to treat pain after surgery or a dental procedure. Sometimes, they are used to treat severe cough or diarrhea. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. When abused, opioids cause a person to feel relaxed and intensely happy (euphoria). In short, the drugs are used to get high.Opioid intoxication is a condition in which you're not only high from using the drug, but you also have body-wide symptoms that can make you ill and impaired.Causes

Opioid intoxication may occur when a health care provider prescribes an opioid, but:The provider doesn't know the person is already taking another opioid at home.The person has a health problem, such as a liver or kidney problem, that may easily result in intoxication.The provider prescribes a sleep medicine (sedative) in addition to the opioid.The provider doesn't know that another provider already prescribed an opioid.In people who use opioids to get high, intoxication may be caused by:Using too much of the drugUsing an opioid with certain other drugs, such as sleep medicine or alcoholTaking the opioid in ways not normally used, such as smoked or inhaled through the nose (snorted)Symptoms

Symptoms depend on how much of the drug is taken.Symptoms of opioid intoxication can include:Altered mental status, such as confusion, delirium, or decreased awareness or responsivenessBreathing problems (breathing may slow and eventually stop)Extreme sleepiness or loss of alertnessNausea and vomitingSmall pupils Exams and Tests

Tests that are ordered depend on the provider's concern for additional medical problems. Tests may include:Blood testsCT scan of the brain, if the person is having seizures or might have a head injuryECG (electrocardiogram) to measure electrical activity in the heartChest x-ray to check for pneumoniaToxicology (poison) screeningTreatment

The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:Breathing support, including oxygen, or a tube that goes through the mouth into the lungs and attachment to a breathing machineIV (fluids given through a vein)Medicine called naloxone (Evzio, Narcan) to block the effect of the opioid on the central nervous systemOther medicines as needed Since the effect of the naloxone is often short, the health care team will monitor the patient for 4 to 6 hours in the emergency department. People with moderate to severe intoxications will likely be admitted to the hospital for 24 to 48 hours.A mental health evaluation is needed if the person is suicidal.Outlook (Prognosis)

Many factors determine the short- and long-term outcome after opioid intoxication. Some of these are:The degree of poisoning, for example, if the person stopped breathing, and for how longHow often the drugs are usedEffect of impurities mixed in with illegal substancesInjuries that occur as a result of the drug useUnderlying medical conditions Possible Complications

 Health problems that may occur include any of the following:Permanent lung damageSeizures, tremorsReduced ability to think clearlyUnsteadiness and difficulty walkingInfections or even permanent damage of the organs as a result of injection use of the drugAlternative Names

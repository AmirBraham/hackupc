 Syphilitic aseptic meningitis, or syphilitic meningitis, is a complication of untreated syphilis. It involves inflammation of the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord caused by this bacterial infection.Â These tissues are called the meninges.Causes

Syphilitic meningitis is a form of neurosyphilis. This condition is a life-threatening complication of syphilis infection. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection.Syphilitic meningitis is similar to meningitis caused by other germs (organisms), but it doesn't develop as quickly.Risks for syphilitic meningitis include a past infection with syphilis or other sexually transmitted illnesses such as gonorrhea. Syphilis infections are mainly spread through sex with an infected person. Sometimes, they may be passed by nonsexual contact.Symptoms

Symptoms of syphilitic meningitis may include:Changes in vision, such as blurred vision, decreased vision
   FeverHeadacheMental status changes, including confusion, decreased attention span, and irritabilityNausea and vomitingStiff neck or shoulders, muscle achesSeizuresSensitivity to light (photophobia) and loud noises
   Sleepiness, lethargy, hard to wake upExams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show problems with the nerves, including nerves that control eye movement.Tests may include:Cerebral angiography to check blood flow in the brainElectroencephalogram (EEG) to measure electrical activity in the brainHead CT scanSpinal tap to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for examinationBlood test to screen for a syphilis infection If screening tests indicate a syphilis infection, more tests are done to confirm the diagnosis.Treatment

The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and stop symptoms from getting worse. Treating the infection helps prevent new nerve damage and may reduce symptoms. Treatment does not reverse existing damage.Medicines likely to be given include:Penicillin or other antibiotics (such as tetracycline or erythromycin) for a long time to make sure the infection goes awayMedicines for seizuresOutlook (Prognosis)

Some people may need help eating, dressing, and caring for themselves. Confusion and other mental changes may either improve or continue long-term after antibiotic treatment.Late-stage syphilis can cause nerve or heart damage. This can lead to disability and death.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Inability to care for selfInability to communicate or interactSeizures that may result in injuryStrokeWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have seizures.Contact your provider if you have a severe headache with fever or other symptoms, especially if you have a history of syphilis infection.Prevention

Proper treatment and follow-up of syphilis infections will reduce the risk of developing this type of meningitis.If you are sexually active, practice safer sex and always use condoms.All pregnant women should be screened for syphilis.Alternative Names

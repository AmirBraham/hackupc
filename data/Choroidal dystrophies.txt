 Choroidal dystrophies are eye disorders that involve a layer of blood vessels called the choroid. These vessels are between the sclera (the white of the eye) and retina (the black of the eye). In most cases, a choroidal dystrophy is due to an abnormal gene, which is passed down through families. It most often affects males, starting in childhood.The first symptoms are peripheral vision loss and vision loss at night. An eye doctor who specializes in the retina (back of the eye) can diagnose this disorder. Exams and Tests

The following tests may be needed to diagnose the condition:ElectroretinographyFluorescein angiographyGenetic testingTreatment

Clinical trials have been underway to try to slow the disease progression by injecting a form of the missing genetic material under the retina.Alternative Names

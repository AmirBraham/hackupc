 Hypovolemic shock is an emergency condition in which severe blood or other fluid loss makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body. This type of shock can cause many organs to stop working.Causes

Losing more than 15 to 20 percent of the normal amount of blood in your body causes hypovolemic shock.Blood loss can be due to:Bleeding from serious cutsBleeding from other injuriesInternal bleeding, such as in the gastrointestinal tractThe amount of circulating blood in your body also may drop when you lose too much body fluid from other causes. This can be due to:
  BurnsDiarrheaExcessive perspirationVomitingSymptoms

Symptoms may include:Anxiety or agitationCool, clammy skinConfusionDecreased or no urine outputGeneralized weaknessPale skin color (pallor)Rapid breathingSweating, moist skinUnconsciousness (lack of responsiveness) The greater and more rapid the blood loss, the more severe the symptoms of shock.Exams and Tests

A physical exam will show signs of shock, including:Low blood pressureLow body temperatureRapid pulse, often weak and thready Tests that may be done include:Blood chemistry, including kidney function tests and those tests looking for evidence of heart muscle damageComplete blood count (CBC)CT scan, ultrasound, or x-ray of areas known or suspected to be injuredEchocardiogram - sound wave test of heart structure and functionElectrocardiogramEndoscopy - tube placed in the mouth to the stomach (upper endoscopy) or colonoscopy (tube placed through the anus to the large bowel)Right heart (Swan-Ganz) catheterizationUrinary catheterization (tube placed into the bladder to measure urine output) In some cases, other tests may be done as well.Treatment

Get medical help right away. In the meantime, follow these steps:Keep the person comfortable and warm (to avoid hypothermia).Have the person lie flat with the feet lifted about 12 inches (30 centimeters) to increase circulation. However, if the person has a head, neck, back, or leg injury, do not change the person's position unless they are in immediate danger.Do not give fluids by mouth.If person is having an allergic reaction, treat the allergic reaction, if you know how.If the person must be carried, try to keep them flat, with the head down and feet lifted. Stabilize the head and neck before moving a person with a suspected spinal injury. The goal of hospital treatment is to replace blood and fluids. One or more intravenous (IV) lines will be placed to allow blood, blood products, or fluids to be given.Medicines such as epinephrine or norepinephrine may be needed to increase blood pressure and the amount of blood pumped out of the heart (cardiac output).Outlook (Prognosis)

Symptoms and outcomes can vary, depending on:Amount of blood/fluid volume lostRate of blood/fluid lossIllness or injury causing the lossUnderlying chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart, lung, and kidney disease, or related to injury In general, people with milder degrees of shock do better than those with more severe shock. Severe hypovolemic shock may lead to death, even with immediate medical attention. Older adults are more likely to have poor outcomes from shock.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Kidney damage (may require temporary or permanent use of a kidney dialysis machine)Brain damageGangrene of arms or legs, sometimes leading to amputationHeart attackOther organ damageDeath When to Contact a Medical Professional

Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency. Call the local emergency number (such as 911) or take the person to the emergency room.Prevention

Preventing shock is easier than trying to treat it once it happens. Quickly treating the cause will reduce the risk of developing severe shock. Early first aid can help control shock.Alternative Names

 Toxoplasmosis is an infection due to the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.Causes

Toxoplasmosis is found in humans worldwide and in many kinds of animals and birds. The parasite also lives in cats.Human infection may result from:
   Blood transfusions or solid organ transplants
   
   Handling cat litter
   
   Eating contaminated soil
   
   Eating raw or undercooked meat (lamb, pork, and beef)
   Toxoplasmosis also affects people who have weakened immune systems. These people are more likely to have symptoms.The infection may also be passed from an infected mother to her baby through the placenta. This results in congenital toxoplasmosis. Symptoms

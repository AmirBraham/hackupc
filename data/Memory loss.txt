 Memory loss is unusual forgetfulness. You may not be able to remember new events, recall one or more memories of the past, or both.The memory loss may be for a short time and then resolve (transient). Or, it may not go away, and, depending on the cause, it can get worse over time.In severe cases, such memory impairment may interfere with daily living activities.Causes

Normal aging can cause some forgetfulness. It is normal to have some trouble learning new material or needing more time to remember it. But normal aging does not lead to dramatic memory loss. Such memory loss is due to other diseases.Memory loss can be caused by many things. To determine a cause, your health care provider will ask if the problem came on suddenly or slowly. Many areas of the brain help you create and retrieve memories. A problem in any of these areas can lead to memory loss.Memory loss may result from a new injury to the brain, which is caused by or is present after:Brain tumorCancer treatment, such as brain radiation, bone marrow transplant, or chemotherapyConcussion or head traumaNot enough oxygen getting to the brain when your heart or breathing is stopped for too longSevere brain infection or infection around brainMajor surgery or severe illness, including brain surgeryTransient global amnesia (sudden, temporary loss of memory) of unclear causeTransient ischemic attack (TIA) or strokeHydrocephalus (fluid collection in the brain) Multiple sclerosisDementiaSometimes, memory loss occurs with mental health problems, such as:After a major, traumatic or stressful eventBipolar disorderDepression or other mental health disorders, such as schizophreniaMemory loss may be a sign of dementia. Dementia also affects thinking, language, judgment, and behavior. Common types of dementia associated with memory loss are:Alzheimer diseaseVascular dementiaLewy body dementiaFronto-temporal dementiaProgressive supranuclear palsyNormal pressure hydrocephalusCreutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseOther causes of memory loss include:Alcohol or use of prescription or illegal drugsBrain infections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, or HIV/AIDSOveruse of medicines, such as barbiturates or (hypnotics)ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) (most often short-term memory loss)Epilepsy that is not well controlledIllness that results in the loss of, or damage to brain tissue or nerve cells, such as Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, or multiple sclerosisLow levels of important nutrients or vitamins, such as low vitamin B1 or B12Home Care

A person with memory loss needs a lot of support.It helps to show the person familiar objects, music, or and photos or play familiar music. Write down when the person should take any medicine or do other important tasks. It is important to write it down. If a person needs help with everyday tasks, or if safety or nutrition is a concern, you may want to consider extended-care facilities, such as a nursing home.What to Expect at Your Office Visit

The provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the person's medical history and symptoms. This will usually include asking questions of family members and friends. For this reason, they may be interviewed in-person or by phone.Medical history questions may include:Type of memory loss, such as short-term or long-termTime pattern, such as how long the memory loss has lasted or whether it comes and goesThings that triggered memory loss, such as head injury or surgery Tests that may be done include:
  Blood tests for specific diseases that are suspected (such as low vitamin B12 or thyroid disease)
  Cerebral angiographyCognitive tests (neuropsychological/psychometric tests)CT scan or MRI of the headEEGLumbar punctureTreatment depends on the cause of memory loss. Your provider can tell you more.Alternative Names

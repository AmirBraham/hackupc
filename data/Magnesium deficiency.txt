 Magnesium deficiency is a condition in which the amount of magnesium in the blood is lower than normal. The medical name of this condition is hypomagnesemia.Causes

Every organ in the body, especially the heart, muscles, and kidneys, needs the mineral magnesium. It also contributes to the makeup of teeth and bones. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body. This includes the physical and chemical processes in the body that convert or use energy (metabolism).When the level of magnesium in the body drops below normal, symptoms may develop due to low magnesium.Common causes of low magnesium include:Alcohol useBurns that affect a large area of the bodyChronic diarrheaExcessive urination (polyuria), such as in uncontrolled diabetes and during recovery from acute kidney injuryHyperaldosteronism (disorder in which the adrenal gland releases too much of the hormone aldosterone into the blood)Kidney tubule disordersMalabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseaseMalnutritionMedicines including amphotericin, antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, cisplatin, cyclosporine, diuretics, proton pump inhibitors, tacrolimus, and aminoglycoside antibioticsPancreatitis (swelling and inflammation of the pancreas)Excessive sweatingSymptoms

Common symptoms include:Abnormal eye movements (nystagmus)ConvulsionsFatigueMuscle spasms or crampsMuscle weaknessNumbnessExams and Tests

Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.Tests that may be ordered include an electrocardiogram (ECG).A blood test will be ordered to check your magnesium level. Normal range is 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/L (0.65 to 1.05 mmol/L).Other blood and urine tests that may be done include:Calcium blood testComprehensive metabolic panelPotassium blood testUrine magnesium testTreatment

Treatment depends on the severity of the low magnesium problem and may include:Fluids given through a vein (IV)Magnesium by mouth or through a veinMedicines to relieve symptomsOutlook (Prognosis)

The outcome depends on the condition that is causing the problem.Possible Complications

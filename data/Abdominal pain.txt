 Abdominal pain is pain that you feel anywhere between your chest and groin. This is often referred to as the stomach region or belly.Considerations

Almost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious. How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain.For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis.However, fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis, may only cause mild pain or no pain.Other ways to describe pain in your abdomen include:Generalized pain -- This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines.Localized pain -- This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach.Cramp-like pain -- This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever.Colicky pain -- This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of belly pain. Causes

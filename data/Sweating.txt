Men's sweat glands tend to be more active.Sweating is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. This is the part of the nervous system that is not under your control. Sweating is the body's natural way of regulating temperature.Things that can make you sweat more include:Hot weatherExerciseSituations that make you nervous, angry, embarrassed, or afraid Heavy sweating may also be a symptom of menopauseÂ (also called a "hot flash").Causes

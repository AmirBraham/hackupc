 Hypervitaminosis D is a condition that occurs after taking very high doses of vitamin D.Causes

The cause is excess intake of vitamin D. The doses need to be very high, far above what most health care providers normally prescribe.There has been a lot of confusion about vitamin D supplementation. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is between 400 and 800 IU/day, according to age and pregnancy status. Higher doses may be needed for some people, such as those with vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and other conditions. However, most people do not need more than 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day.For most people, vitamin D toxicity only occurs with vitamin D doses above 10,000 IU per day.Symptoms

 Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a rapid heart rate. It occurs when too many signals (electrical impulses) are sent from the upper heart (atria) to the lower heart (ventricles).Causes

The human heart gives off electrical impulses, or signals, which tell it to beat. Normally, these signals begin in an area of the upper right chamber called the sinoatrial node (sinus node or SA node). This node is considered the heart's "natural pacemaker." It helps control the heartbeat. When the heart detects a signal, it contracts (or beats). The normal heart rate in adults is about 60 to 100 beats per minute. The normal heart rate is faster in children.In MAT, many locations in the atria fire signals at the same time. Too many signals lead to a rapid heart rate. It most often ranges from 100 to 130 beats per minute or more in adults. The rapid heart rate may cause the heart to work too hard and not move blood efficiently. If the heartbeat is very fast, there is less time for the heart chamber to fill with blood between beats. Therefore, not enough blood is pumped to the brain and the rest of the body with each contraction.MAT is most common in people age 50 and over. It is often seen in people with conditions that lower the amount of oxygen in the blood. These conditions include:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Congestive heart failureLung cancerLung failurePneumoniaPulmonary embolismYou may be at higher risk for MAT if you have:Coronary heart diseaseDiabetesHad surgery within the last 6 weeksOverdosed on the drug theophyllineSepsis When the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the arrhythmia is called "wandering atrial pacemaker."Symptoms

Some people may have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:Chest tightnessFaintingLightheadednessSensation of feeling the heart is beating irregularly or too fast (palpitations)Shortness of breathWeight loss and failure to thrive in infantsOther symptoms that can occur with this disease:Breathing difficulty when lying downDizzinessExams and Tests

A physical exam shows a fast irregular heartbeat of over 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure is normal or low. There may be signs of poor circulation.Tests to diagnose MAT include:ECGElectrophysiologic study (EPS) Heart monitors may be used to record the rapid heartbeat. These include:24-hour Holter monitorPortable, long-term loop recorders thatÂ allow you to start recording if symptoms occur If you are in the hospital, your heart rhythm will be monitored 24 hours a day, at least at first. Treatment

If you have a condition that can lead to MAT, that condition should be treated first.Treatment for MAT includes:
  Improving blood oxygen levels
  
  Giving magnesium or potassium through a vein
  
  Stopping medicines, such as theophylline, which can increase heart rate
  
  Taking medicines to slow the heart rate (if the heart rate is too fast), such as calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) or beta-blockers
  Outlook (Prognosis)

MAT can be controlled if the condition that causes the rapid heartbeat is treated and controlled.Possible Complications

Complications may include:CardiomyopathyCongestive heart failureReduced pumping action of the heartWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if:You have a rapid or irregular heartbeat with other MAT symptomsYou have MAT and your symptoms get worse, do not improve with treatment, or you develop new symptomsPrevention

To reduce the risk for developing MAT, treat the disorders that cause it right away.Alternative Names

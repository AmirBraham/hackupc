How well someone does depends on how much indomethacin was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the medical help is received, the better the chance for recovery.A mild overdose of this medicine does not usually cause serious problems. There may be some stomach pain and vomiting (possibly with blood).However, a large amount of internal bleeding is possible, and a blood transfusion may be needed. Endoscopy may be needed to stop the internal bleeding.In rare cases, there can be ringing in the ears and a bad headache. But these symptoms will likely pass as well.If kidney damage is severe, dialysis (kidney machine) may be needed until kidney function returns. In some cases, the damage is permanent.A large overdose can be very harmful to children and adults. Death may occur.Alternative Names

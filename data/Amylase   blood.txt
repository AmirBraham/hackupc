 Amylase is an enzyme that helps digest carbohydrates. It is made primarily in the pancreas and the glands that make saliva, and can be found at low levels in other parts of the body. When the pancreas is diseased or inflamed, it releases increased amounts of amylase into the blood.A test can be done to measure the level of this enzyme in your blood.Amylase may also be measured with a urine amylase test.How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is taken from a vein.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is needed. However, you should avoid alcohol before the test. The health care provider may ask you to stop taking drugs that may affect the test. Do not stop taking any medicines without first talking to your provider.Drugs that can increase amylase measurements include:AsparaginaseAspirinBirth control pillsCholinergic medicinesEthacrynic acidMethyldopaOpiates (codeine, meperidine, and morphine)Thiazide diureticsHow the Test will Feel

You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.Why the Test is Performed

This test is most often used to diagnose or monitor acute pancreatitis. It may also detect some digestive tract problems.The test may also be done for the following conditions:Chronic pancreatitisPancreatic pseudocystNormal Results

The normal range is 40 to 140 units per liter (U/L) or 0.38 to 1.42 microkat/L (Âµkat/L).Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurement methods. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Increased blood amylase level may occur due to:Acute pancreatitisCancer of the pancreas, ovaries, or lungsCholecystitisInfection of the salivary glands (such as mumps) or a blockage of the salivary gland ductIntestinal blockageMacroamylasemiaPancreatic or bile duct blockagePerforated ulcerTubal pregnancy (may have burst open)Viral hepatitisDecreased amylase level may occur due to:Bone fractureCongestive heart failureDamage to the pancreas with pancreatic scarringGastrointestinal cancerPregnancyRisks

 Blastomycosis is an infection caused by breathing in the Blastomyces dermatitidis fungus. The fungus is found in decaying wood and soil.Causes

You can get blastomycosis by contact with moist soil, most commonly where there is rotting wood and leaves. The fungus enters the body through the lungs, where the infection starts. The fungus can then spread to other parts of the body. The disease may affect the skin, bones and joints, and other areas.Blastomycosis is rare. It is found in the central and southeastern United States, and in Canada, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Africa.The key risk factor for the disease is contact with infected soil. It most often affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or who have had an organ transplant, but it can also infect healthy people. Men are more likely to be affected than women.Symptoms

Lung infection may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms may be seen if the infection spreads. Symptoms may include:Joint painChest pain 
 Cough (may produce brown or bloody mucus)Fatigue 
 FeverNight sweatsGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)Muscle painUnintentional weight lossMost people develop skin symptoms when the infection spreads. You may get papules, pustules, or nodules on exposed body areas.The pustules:May look like warts or ulcersAre usually painlessVary in color from gray to violetMay appear in the nose and mouthBleed easily and form ulcers Exams and Tests

The provider may recommend the following antifungal medicines when the disease is severe or spreads outside of the lungs.FluconazoleItraconazoleKetoconazoleAmphotericin B may be used for severe infections.Follow up regularly with your provider to make sure the infection does not return.Outlook (Prognosis)

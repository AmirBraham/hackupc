 Left heart ventricular angiography is a procedure to look at the left-sided heart chambers and the function of the left-sided valves. It is sometimes combined with coronary angiography.How the Test is Performed

Before the test, you will be given medicine to help you relax. You will be awake and able to follow instructions during the test.An intravenous line is placed in your arm. The health care provider cleans and numbs an area on your arm or groin. A cardiologist makes a small cut in the area, and inserts a thin flexible tube (catheter) into an artery. Using x-rays as a guide, the doctor carefully moves the thin tube (catheter) into your heart.When the tube is in place, dye is injected through it. The dye flows through the blood vessels, making them easier to see. X-rays are taken as the dye moves through the blood vessels. These x-ray pictures create a "movie" of the left ventricle as it contracts rhythmically.The procedure will usually last less than one hour but may be considerably longer.How to Prepare for the Test

You will be told not to eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The procedure takes place in the hospital. Some people may need to stay in the hospital the night before the test.A provider will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form for the procedure. How the Test will Feel

You will feel a sting and burn when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pressure when the catheter is inserted. Occasionally, a flushing sensation or a feeling that you need to urinate occurs when the dye is injected.Why the Test is Performed

Left heart angiography is performed to assess the blood flow through the left side of the heart.Normal Results

A normal result shows normal blood flow through the left side of the heart. Blood volumes and pressures are also normal.What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be due to:A hole in the heart (ventricular septal defect)Abnormalities of the left heart valvesAn aneurysm of the heart wallAreas of the heart that are not contracting normallyBlood flow problems on the left side of the heartHeart-related blockagesWeakened pumping function of the left ventricleCoronary angiography may be needed when blockage of the coronary arteries is suspected.Risks

Risks associated with this procedure include:Abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias)Allergic reaction to dye or sedating medicinesArtery or vein damageCardiac tamponadeEmbolism from blood clots at the tip of the catheterHeart failure due to the volume of the dyeInfectionKidney failure from the dyeLow blood pressureHeart attackHemorrhageStrokeConsiderations

Right heart catheterization may be combined with this procedure.Left heart ventricular angiography has some risk because it is an invasive procedure. Other imaging techniques may carry less risk, such as:CT scansEchocardiographyMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heartRadionuclide ventriculographyYour provider may decide to perform one of these procedures instead of left heart ventricular angiography.Alternative Names

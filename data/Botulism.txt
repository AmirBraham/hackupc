 Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. The bacteria may enter the body through wounds or by eating improperly canned or preserved food.Causes

Clostridium botulinum are found in soil and untreated water throughout the world. The bacteria produce protective spores to help them survive. In certain conditions, such as improperly preserved or canned food, these spores can grow and produce a toxin. When eaten, even tiny amounts of this toxin can lead to severe poisoning. Foods that can be contaminated include:Home-canned vegetablesCured pork and hamSmoked or raw fishHoney or corn syrupBaked potatoes cooked in foilCarrot juiceChopped garlic in oilInfant botulism occurs when a baby eats Clostridium botulinum spores and the bacteria grow in the baby's intestines. The most common cause of infant botulism is eating honey or corn syrup or using pacifiers that have been coated with honey.Clostridium botulinum can be found normally in the stool of some infants. Infants develop botulism when the bacteria grow in their gut.Botulism may also occur if the bacteria enter open wounds and produce toxins there.About 110 cases of botulism are reported in the United States each year. Most of the cases are in infants.Symptoms

Symptoms often appear 8 to 36 hours after you eat food contaminated with the toxin. There is no fever with this infection.In adults, symptoms may include:Abdominal crampsBreathing difficulty that may lead to respiratory failureDifficulty swallowing and speakingDouble visionNauseaVomitingWeakness with paralysis (equal on both sides of the body) Symptoms in infants may include:ConstipationDroolingPoor feeding and weak suckingRespiratory distressWeak cryWeakness, loss of muscle tone Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may find:Absent or decreased deep tendon reflexesAbsent or decreased gag reflexEyelid droopingLoss of muscle function, starting at the top of the body and moving downParalyzed bowelSpeech impairmentUrine retention with inability to urinateBlurred visionNo fever Blood tests can be done to identify the toxin. A stool culture may also be ordered. Lab tests can be done on the suspected food to confirm botulism.Treatment

You will need medicine to fight the toxin produced by the bacteria. The medicine is called botulism antitoxin.You will have to stay in the hospital if you have breathing trouble. A tube may be inserted through the nose or mouth into the windpipe to provide an airway for oxygen. You may need a breathing machine.People who have trouble swallowing may be given fluids through a vein (by IV). A feeding tube may be inserted.Providers must tell state health authorities or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about people with botulism, so that the contaminated food is removed from stores.Some people are given antibiotics, but they may not always help. Outlook (Prognosis)

Prompt treatment greatly reduces the risk for death.Possible Complications

Health problems that may result from botulism include:Aspiration pneumonia and infectionLong-lasting weaknessNervous system problems for up to 1 yearRespiratory distressWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you suspect botulism.Prevention

NEVER give honey or corn syrup to infants younger than 1 year old. Never give even just a little taste on a pacifier.Help prevent infant botulism by breastfeeding only, if possible.Always throw away bulging cans or foul-smelling preserved foods. Sterilize home-canned foods by pressure cooking them at 250째F (121째C) for 30 minutes. This can reduce the risk for botulism.See the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on home canning safety at www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/home-canning-and-botulism.html.Keep foil-wrapped baked potatoes hot or in the refrigerator. Do not store at room temperature. Carrot juice and oils with garlic or other herbs should also be refrigerated. Make sure to set the refrigerator temperature at 40째F (10째C) or lower.Alternative Names

 Personality disorders are a group of mental conditions in which a person has a long-term pattern of behaviors, emotions, and thoughts that is very different from his or her culture's expectations. These behaviors interfere with the person's ability to function in relationships, work, or other settings.Causes

Causes of personality disorders are unknown. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role.Mental health professionals categorize these disorders into the following types:Antisocial personality disorderAvoidant personality disorderBorderline personality disorderDependent personality disorderHistrionic personality disorderNarcissistic personality disorderObsessive-compulsive personality disorderParanoid personality disorderSchizoid personality disorderSchizotypal personality disorderSymptoms

Symptoms vary widely, depending on the type of personality disorder.In general, personality disorders involve feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that don't adapt well to a wide range of settings.These patterns usually begin in the teens and may lead to problems in social and work situations.The severity of these conditions ranges from mild to severe.Exams and Tests

Personality disorders are diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation. The health care provider will consider how long-lived and how severe the person's symptoms are.Treatment

At first, people with these disorders usually don't seek treatment on their own. This is because they feel the disorder is part of themselves. They tend to seek help once their behavior has caused severe problems in their relationships or work. They may also seek help when they are struggling with another mental health problem, such as a mood or substance use disorder.Although personality disorders take time to treat, certain forms of talk therapy are helpful. In some cases, medicines are a useful addition.Outlook (Prognosis)

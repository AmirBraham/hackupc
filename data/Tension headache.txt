 A tension headache is the most common type of headache. It is pain or discomfort in the head, scalp, or neck, and is often associated with muscle tightness in these areas.Causes

Tension headaches occur when neck and scalp muscles become tense or contract. The muscle contractions can be a response to stress, depression, head injury, or anxiety.They may occur at any age, but are most common in adults and older teens. It is slightly more common in women and tends to run in families.Any activity that causes the head to be held in one position for a long time without moving can cause a headache. Activities may include typing or other computer work, fine work with the hands, and using a microscope. Sleeping in a cold room or sleeping with the neck in an abnormal position may also trigger a tension headache.Other triggers of tension headaches include:Physical or emotional stressAlcohol useCaffeine (too much or withdrawal)Colds, the flu, or a sinus infectionDental problems such as jaw clenching or teeth grindingEye strainExcessive smokingFatigue or overexertion Tension headaches can occur when you also have a migraine. Tension headaches are not associated with brain diseases.Symptoms

The headache pain may be described as:Dull, pressure-like (not throbbing)A tight band or vise on or around the headAll over (not just in one point or one side)Worse in the scalp, temples, or back of the neck, and possibly in the shoulders The pain may occur once, constantly, or daily. Pain may last for 30 minutes to 7 days. It may be triggered by or get worse with stress, fatigue, noise, or glare.You may have difficulty sleeping. Tension headaches usually do not cause nausea or vomiting.People with tension headaches try to relieve pain by massaging their scalp, temples, or the bottom of the neck.Exams and Tests

If your headache is mild to moderate, without other symptoms, and responds to home treatment within a few hours, you may not need further examination or testing. With a tension headache, there are usually no problems with the nervous system. But tender points (trigger points) in the muscles are often found in the neck and shoulder areas.Treatment

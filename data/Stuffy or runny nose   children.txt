 A stuffy or congested nose occurs when the tissues lining the nose become swollen. The swelling is due to inflamed blood vessels. The problem may also include nasal discharge or "runny nose." If excess mucus runs down the back of the throat (postnasal drip), it may cause a cough or sore throat.Considerations

Most of the time, nasal congestion in older children and adolescents is not serious by itself, but can cause other problems. When nasal stuffiness is just on one side, the child may have inserted something into the nose. Nasal congestion can interfere with the ears, hearing, and speech development. Congestion that is very bad may interfere with sleep.The mucous drainage may plug up the eustachian tube between the nose and the ear, causing an ear infection and pain. The mucous drip may also plug the sinus passages, causing sinus infection and pain.Causes

A stuffy or runny nose may be caused by: Common coldFluSinus infectionThe congestion typically goes away by itself within a week. Congestion also can be caused by: Hay fever or other allergiesUse of some nasal sprays or drops bought without a prescription for more than 3 days (may make nasal stuffiness worse) Nasal polyps, sac-like growths of inflamed tissue lining the nose or sinusesPregnancy Vasomotor rhinitisSmall objects in the nostrilHome Care

Tips to help infants and younger children include: Raise the head of your child's bed. Put a pillow underneath the head of the mattress. Or, place books or boards under the legs at the head of the bed.Older children may drink extra fluids, but those fluids should be sugar-free.You can try a cool-mist vaporizer, but avoid putting too much moisture in the room. Clean the vaporizer every day with bleach or a disinfectant cleaning product.You can also steam up the bathroom shower and bring your child in there before bed. A nasal wash can help remove mucus from your child's nose. You can buy a saline spray at a drugstore or make one at home.

 Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is anemia that is found in people with certain long-term (chronic) medical conditions that involve inflammation.Causes

Anemia is a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells in the blood. ACD is a common cause of anemia. Some conditions that can lead to ACD include:Autoimmune disorders, such as Crohn disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitisCancer, including lymphoma and Hodgkin diseaseLong-term infections, such as bacterial endocarditis, osteomyelitis (bone infection), HIV/AIDS, lung abscess,Â hepatitis B or hepatitis CSymptoms

Anemia of chronic disease is often mild. You may not notice any symptoms.When symptoms occur, they may include:Feeling weak or tiredHeadachePalenessShortness of breath Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Anemia may be the first symptom of a serious illness, so finding its cause is very important. Tests that may be done to diagnose anemia or rule out other causes include:Complete blood countReticulocyte countSerum ferritin levelSerum iron levelC-reactive protein levelErythrocyte sedimentation rateBone marrow examination (in rare cases to rule out cancer)Treatment

Anemia is often mild enough that it does not need treatment. It may get better when the disease that is causing it is treated.More severe anemia, such as that caused by cancer or HIV/AIDS may require:Blood transfusionErythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, given as a shotOutlook (Prognosis)

The anemia will improve when the disease that is causing it is treated.Possible Complications

Discomfort from symptoms is the main complication in most cases. Anemia may lead to a higher risk for death in people with heart failure.When to Contact a Medical Professional

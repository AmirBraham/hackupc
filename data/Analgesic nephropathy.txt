 Analgesic nephropathy involves damage to one or both kidneys caused by overexposure to mixtures of medicines, especially over-the-counter pain medicines (analgesics).Causes

Analgesic nephropathy involves damage within the internal structures of the kidney. It is caused by long-term use of analgesics (pain medicines), especially over-the-counter (OTC) medicines that contain phenacetin or acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.This condition frequently occurs as a result of self-medicating, often for some type of chronic pain such as headache or arthritis.Risk factors include:Use of OTC analgesics containing more than one active ingredientTaking 6 or more pills a day for 3 yearsChronic headaches, painful menstrual periods, backache, or musculoskeletal painEmotional or behavioral changesHistory of dependent behaviors including smoking, alcohol use, and excessive use of tranquilizersSymptoms

There may be no symptoms in the beginning. Over time, as the kidneys are injured by the medicine, symptoms of kidney disease will develop, including:Fatigue, weaknessIncreased urinary frequency or urgency
   Blood in the urine
   Flank pain or back painDecreased urine outputDecreased alertness, including drowsiness, confusion, and lethargy
   Decreased sensation, numbness (especially in the legs)Nausea, vomitingEasy bruising or bleedingSwelling (edema) throughout the bodyExams and Tests

  Treatment

The primary goals of treatment are to prevent further damage of the kidneys and to treat kidney failure. Your provider may tell you to stop taking all suspect painkillers, particularly OTC medicines.To treat kidney failure, your provider may suggest diet changes and fluid restriction.

 Ear emergencies include objects in the ear canal, ruptured eardrums, sudden hearing loss, and severe infections.Considerations

Children often put objects into their ears. These objects can be hard to remove. The ear canal is a tube of solid bone that is lined with thin, sensitive skin. Any object pressing against the skin can be very painful. In many cases, a health care provider will need to use special instruments to examine the ear and safely remove the object.Causes

Pain, hearing loss, dizziness, ringing in the ear, and ruptured eardrums can be caused by:Inserting cotton swabs, toothpicks, pins, pens, or other objects into the earSudden changes in pressure, as from an explosion, blow to the head, flying, scuba diving, falling while water skiing, or being slapped on the head or earLoud sounds, such as a gun firing Inflammation of the inner or middle earSymptoms

Symptoms include:Bleeding from the earBruising or rednessClear liquid coming out of the ear (brain fluid)DizzinessEaracheLoss of hearingNausea and vomitingNoises in the earSensations of an object in the earSwellingVisible object in the earFeverHearing lossFirst Aid

Depending on the type of ear emergency, follow the steps below.OBJECT IN THE EARCalm and reassure the person.If the object is sticking out and is easy to remove, gently remove it by hand or with tweezers. Then, get medical help to make sure the entire object has been removed.If you think a small object may be lodged inside the ear, but you cannot see it, DO NOT reach inside the ear canal with tweezers. You can do more harm than good.Try using gravity to get the object out by tilting the head to the affected side. DO NOT strike the person's head. Shake it gently in the direction of the ground to try to dislodge the object.If the object does not come out, get medical help. INSECT IN THE EARDO NOT let the person put a finger in the ear. This may make the insect sting.Turn the person's head so that the affected side is up and wait to see if the insect flies or crawls out.If this does not work, try pouring mineral oil, olive oil, or baby oil into the ear. For an adult, pull the ear lobe gently backward and upward as you pour the oil. For a child, pull the ear lobe backward and downward as you pour. The insect should suffocate and may float out in the oil. AVOID using oil to remove any object other than an insect, since oil can cause other types of foreign objects to swell.Even if an insect appears to come out, get medical attention. Small insect parts can irritate the sensitive skin of the ear canal. RUPTURED EARDRUMThe person will have severe pain.Place sterile cotton gently in the outer ear canal to keep the inside of the ear clean.Get medical help.Do not put any liquid into the ear. CUTS ON THE OUTER EARApply direct pressure until the bleeding stops.Cover the injury with a sterile dressing shaped to the contour of the ear, and tape it loosely in place.Apply cold compresses over the dressing to reduce pain and swelling.If part of the ear has been cut off, keep the part. Get medical help right away.Place the part in a clean cloth and keep it on ice. DRAINAGE FROM INSIDE THE EARCover the outside of the ear with a sterile dressing shaped to the contour of the ear, and tape it loosely in place.Have the person lie down on the side with the affected ear down so that it can drain. However, DO NOT move the person if a neck or back injury is suspected.Get medical help right away. DO NOT

If someone has an ear emergency, remember the following:DO NOT block any drainage coming from the ear.DO NOT try to clean or wash the inside of the ear canal.DO NOT put any liquid into the ear.DO NOT attempt to remove the object by probing with a cotton swab, a pin, or any other tool. To do so will risk pushing the object farther into the ear and damaging the middle ear.DO NOT reach inside the ear canal with tweezers.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Peritonsillar abscess is a collection of infected material in the area around the tonsils.Causes

Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of tonsillitis. It is most often caused by a type of bacteria called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.Peritonsillar abscess most often occurs in older children, adolescents, and young adults. The condition is rare now that antibiotics are used to treat tonsillitis.Symptoms

One or both tonsils become infected. The infection may spread to the area around the tonsil. It can then spread down into the neck and chest. Swollen tissues can block the airway. This is a life-threatening medical emergency.The abscess can break open (rupture) into the throat. The contents of the abscess can travel into the lungs and cause pneumonia.Symptoms of peritonsillar abscess include:Fever and chillsSevere throat pain that is usually on one sideEar pain on the side of the abscessDifficulty opening the mouth, and pain with opening the mouthSwallowing problemsDrooling or inability to swallow salivaFacial or neck swellingFeverHeadacheMuffled voiceTender glands of the jaw and throat Neck stiffnessExams and Tests

An exam of the throat often shows swelling on one side and on the roof of the mouth.The uvula in the back of the throat may be shifted away from the swelling. The neck and throat may be red and swollen on one or both sides.The following tests may be done:Aspiration of the abscess using a needleCT scanFiber optic endoscopy to check if the airway is blockedTreatment

The infection can be treated with antibiotics if it is caught early. If an abscess has developed, it will need to be drained with a needle or by cutting it open. You will be given pain medicine before this is done.If the infection is very severe, the tonsils will be removed at the same time the abscess is drained, but this is rare. In this case, you will have general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free.Â  Outlook (Prognosis)

In most cases, peritonsillar abscess goes away with treatment. The infection may return in the future.Possible Complications

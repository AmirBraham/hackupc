The newborn may have:Yellow skin (jaundice)Yellow eyes (icterus)LethargyIf untreated, seizures and neurologic problems (kernicterus) may develop.Exams and Tests

Blood tests for bilirubin levels can identify the severity of the jaundice.Treatment

Phototherapy with blue light is used to treat the high level of bilirubin. An exchange transfusion is sometimes necessary if the levels are extremely high.Outlook (Prognosis)

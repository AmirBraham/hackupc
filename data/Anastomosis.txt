 An anastomosis is a surgical connection between two structures. It usually means a connection that is created between tubular structures, such as blood vessels or loops of intestine.For example, when part of an intestine is surgically removed, the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed). The procedure is known as an intestinal anastomosis.Information

Examples of surgical anastomoses are:Arteriovenous fistula (an opening created between an artery and vein) for dialysisColostomy (an opening created between the bowel and the skin of the abdominal wall)
   Intestinal, in which two ends of intestine are sewn together

 Impaired smell is the partial or total loss or abnormal perception of the sense of smell. Considerations

The loss of smell can occur with conditions that prevent air from reaching smell receptors located high in the nose, or loss of or injury to the smell receptors. Loss of smell is not serious, but can sometimes be a sign of a nervous system condition. Temporary loss of the sense of smell is common with colds and nasal allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis). It may occur after a viral illness. Some loss of smell occurs with aging. In most cases, there is no clear cause, and there is no treatment. The sense of smell also enhances your ability to taste. Many people who lose their sense of smell also complain that they lose their sense of taste. Most can still tell between salty, sweet, sour, and bitter tastes, which are sensed on the tongue. They may not be able to tell between other flavors. Some spices (such as pepper) may affect the nerves of the face. You may feel rather than smell them. Causes

Loss of smell can be caused by:Medicines that change or decrease the ability to detect odors, such as amphetamines, estrogen, naphazoline, trifluoperazine, long-term use of nasal decongestants, reserpine, and possibly zinc-based productsBlockage of the nose due to nasal polyps, nasal septal deformities, and nasal tumorsInfections in the nose, throat, or sinusesAllergiesEndocrine disordersDementia or other neurological problemsNutritional deficienciesHead injuryNasal or sinus surgeryRadiation therapy to the head or face Home Care

Treating the cause of the problem may correct the lost sense of smell. Treatment can include:Antihistamines (if the condition is due to an allergy)Changes in medicineSurgery to correct blockagesTreatment of other disordersOlfactory retraining therapy using familiar odors can help improve the sense of smell in a minority of patientsAvoid using too many nasal decongestants, which can lead to repeated nasal congestion.If you lose your sense of smell, you may have changes in taste. Adding highly seasoned foods to your diet can help stimulate the taste sensations that you still have.Improve your safety at home by using smoke detectors and electric appliances instead of gas appliances. You may not be able to smell gas if there is a leak. Or, install equipment that detects gas fumes in the home. People with smell loss should label when food items were opened to prevent eating spoiled food.There is no treatment for loss of smell due to aging.If you have a loss of smell due to a recent upper respiratory infection, be patient. The sense of smell often returns to normal without treatment.When to Contact a Medical Professional

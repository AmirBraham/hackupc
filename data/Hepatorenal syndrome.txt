 Hepatorenal syndrome is a condition in which there is progressive kidney failure that occurs in a person with cirrhosis of the liver. It is a serious complication that can lead to death. Causes

Hepatorenal syndrome occurs when the kidneys stop working well in people with serious liver problems. Less urine is produced by the body, so waste products that contain nitrogen build up in the bloodstream (azotemia).The disorder occurs in up to 1 in 10 people who are in the hospital with liver failure. It leads to kidney failure in people with:Acute liver failureAlcoholic hepatitisCirrhosisInfected abdominal fluid (peritonitis)Risk factors include:Blood pressure that falls when a person rises or suddenly changes position (orthostatic hypotension)Use of medicines called diuretics ("water pills")Gastrointestinal bleedingInfectionRecent abdominal fluid removal (paracentesis) Symptoms

Symptoms include:Abdominal swelling due to fluid (called ascites, a symptom of liver disease)Mental confusionMuscle jerksDark-colored urine (a symptom of liver disease)Decreased urine outputNausea and vomitingWeight gainYellow skin (jaundice, a symptom of liver disease) Exams and Tests

This condition is diagnosed after testing to rule out other causes of kidney failure. A physical exam does not detect kidney failure directly. However, the exam will very often show signs of chronic liver disease, such as:Confusion (often due to hepatic encephalopathy)Excess fluid in the abdomen (ascites)JaundiceOther signs of liver failure Other signs include:Abnormal reflexesSmaller testiclesDull sound in the belly area when tapped with the tips of the fingersIncreased breast tissue in men (gynecomastia)Sores (lesions) on the skin The following may be signs of kidney failure:Very little or no urine outputFluid retention in the abdomen or extremitiesIncreased BUN and creatinine blood levelsIncreased urine specific gravity and osmolalityLow blood sodiumVery low urine sodium concentration The following may be signs of liver failure:Abnormal prothrombin time (PT)Increased blood ammonia levelLow blood albuminParacentesis shows ascitesSigns of hepatic encephalopathy (an EEG may be done) Treatment

The goal of treatment is to help the liver work better and to make sure the heart is able to pump enough blood to the body. Treatment is about the same as for kidney failure from any cause. It includes:Stopping all unnecessary medicines, especially ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, and diuretics ("water pills")Having dialysis to improve symptomsTaking medicines to improve blood pressure and help your kidneys work better; infusion of albumin may also be helpfulPlacing a shunt (known as TIPS) to relieve the symptoms of ascites (this may also help kidney function, but the procedure can be risky)Surgery to place a shunt from the abdominal space to the jugular vein to relieve some symptoms of kidney failure (this procedure is risky and is rarely done)Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome is often poor. Death often occurs due to an infection or severe bleeding (hemorrhage).Possible Complications

Complications may include:BleedingDamage to, and failure of, many organ systemsEnd-stage kidney diseaseFluid overload and heart failure Coma caused by liver failureSecondary infectionsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

This disorder most often is diagnosed in the hospital during treatment for a liver disorder.Alternative Names

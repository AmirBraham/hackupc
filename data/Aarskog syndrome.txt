 Aarskog syndrome is a very rare disease that affects a person's height, muscles, skeleton, genitals, and appearance. It can be passed down through families (inherited).Causes

Aarskog syndrome is a genetic disorder that is linked to the X chromosome. It affects mainly males, but females may have a milder form. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in a gene called "faciogenital dysplasia" (FGD1).Symptoms

Symptoms of this condition include:Belly button that sticks outBulge in the groin or scrotumDelayed sexual maturityDelayed teethDownward palpebral slant to eyes (palpebral slant is the direction of the slant from the inner to outer corner of the eye)Hairline with a "widow's peak"Mildly sunken chest (pectus excavatum)Mild to moderate cognitive problemsMild to moderate short height which may not be obvious until the child is 1 to 3 years oldPoorly developed middle section of the faceRounded faceScrotum surrounds the penis (shawl scrotum)Short fingers and toes with mild webbingSingle crease in the palm of the handSmall, broad hands and feet with short fingers and curved-in fifth fingerSmall nose with nostrils tipped forwardTesticles that have not come down (undescended)Top portion of the ear folded over slightlyWide groove above the upper lip, crease below the lower lipWide-set eyes with droopy eyelids Exams and Tests

These tests may be done:Genetic testing for mutations in the FGD1 geneX-rays Treatment

Moving the teeth may be done to treat some of the abnormal dental features a person with Aarskog syndrome may have.Support Groups

More information and support for people with Aarskog syndrome and their families can be found at:National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/aarskog-syndromeNIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center -- rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/4775/aarskog-syndromeOutlook (Prognosis)

Some people may have some mental slowness, but children with this condition often have good social skills. Some males may have problems with fertility.Possible Complications

These complications can occur:Changes in the brainDifficulty growing in the first year of lifePoorly aligned teethSeizuresUndescended testiclesWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if your child has delayed growth or if you notice any symptoms of Aarskog syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Aarskog syndrome. Contact a genetic specialist if your provider thinks you or your child may have Aarskog syndrome.Prevention

Genetic testing may be available for people with a family history of the condition or a known mutation of the gene that causes it.

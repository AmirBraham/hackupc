 Pneumonia is inflammation (swelling) and infection of the lungs or large airways.Aspiration pneumonia occurs when food or liquid is breathed into the airways or lungs, instead of being swallowed.Causes

Risk factors for breathing in (aspiration) of foreign material into the lungs are:Being less alert due to medicines, illness, surgery, or other reasonsComaDrinking large amounts of alcoholTaking illicit drugs (such as opioids) which make you less alertReceiving medicine to put you into a deep sleep for surgery (general anesthesia)Old agePoor gag reflex in people who are not alert (unconscious or semi-conscious) after a stroke or brain injuryProblems with swallowingEating or being fed when not uprightBeing hospitalized can increase the risk for this condition.Materials that may be breathed into the lungs include:SalivaVomitLiquidsFoodsThe type of bacteria that causes the pneumonia depends on:Your healthWhere you live (at home or in a long-term nursing facility, for example)Whether you were recently hospitalizedYour recent antibiotic useWhether your immune system is weakenedSymptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Chest painCoughing up foul-smelling, greenish or dark phlegm (sputum), or phlegm that contains pus or bloodFatigue
   Fever
   Shortness of breathWheezingBreath odor
   Excessive sweating
   Problems swallowing ConfusionSeeing food or tube feed material (if being fed artificially) in your sputumExams and Tests

Your health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen for crackles or abnormal breath sounds in your chest. Tapping on your chest wall (percussion) helps the provider listen and feel for abnormal sounds in your chest.If pneumonia is suspected, your provider will likely order a chest x-ray.The following tests also may help diagnose this condition:Arterial blood gasBlood cultureBronchoscopyÂ (uses a special scope to view the lung airways) in some casesComplete blood count (CBC)
   X-rays or CT scan of the chestSputum cultureSwallowing tests Treatment

Some people may need to be hospitalized. Treatment depends on how severe the pneumonia is and how ill the person is before the aspiration (chronic illness). Sometimes a ventilator (breathing machine) is needed to support breathing.You will likely receive antibiotics. You may need to have your swallowing function tested. People who have trouble swallowing may need to use other feeding methods to reduce the risk of aspiration.Outlook (Prognosis)

Outcome depends on:The health of the person before getting pneumoniaThe type of bacteria causing the pneumoniaHow much of the lungs are involved More severe infections may result in long-term damage to the lungs.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Lung abscessShockSpread of infection to the bloodstream (bacteremia)Spread of infection to other areas of the bodyRespiratory failureDeath When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider, go to the emergency room, or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have:Chest painChillsFeverShortness of breathBluish discoloration of the lips or tongue (cyanosis)Wheezing Alternative Names

It often takes about 6 weeks before these medicines start working. Many people do not get relief from these medicines.Aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), which may relieve symptoms for some men.Muscle relaxers like diazepam or cyclobenzaprine can help to reduce spasms in the pelvic floor. Some people have found some relief from pollen extract (Cernitin) and allopurinol. But research does not confirm their benefit. Stool softeners may help reduce discomfort with bowel movements.Surgery, called transurethral resection of the prostate, may be done in rare cases if medicine does not help. In most cases, this surgery is not done on younger men. It may cause retrograde ejaculation. The surgery can lead to sterility, impotence, and incontinence.Other treatments that may be tried include:Warm baths to ease some of the painProstate massage, acupuncture, and relaxation exercisesDietary changes to avoid bladder and urinary tract irritantsPelvic floor physical therapy Outlook (Prognosis)

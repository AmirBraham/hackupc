 Breath odor is the scent of the air you breathe out of your mouth. Unpleasant breath odor is commonly called bad breath.Considerations

Bad breath is usually related to poor dental hygiene. Not brushing and flossing regularly causes sulfur compounds to be released by bacteria in the mouth.Some disorders will produce distinct breath odors. Some examples are:A fruity odor to the breath is a sign of ketoacidosis, which may occur in diabetes. It is a potentially life-threatening condition.Breath that smells like feces can occur with prolonged vomiting, especially when there is a bowel obstruction. It may also occur temporarily if a person has a tube placed through the nose or mouth to drain their stomach.The breath may have an ammonia-like odor (also described as urine-like or "fishy") in people with chronic kidney failure.Causes

Bad breath may be caused by:Abscessed toothGum surgeryAlcoholismCavitiesDenturesEating certain foods, such as cabbage, garlic, or raw onionsCoffee and poorly pH-balanced dietObject stuck in the nose (usually happens in kids); often a white, yellow, or bloody discharge from one nostrilGum disease (gingivitis, gingivostomatitis, ANUG)Impacted toothPoor dental hygieneTonsils with deep crypts and sulfur granulesSinus infectionThroat infectionTobacco smokingVitamin supplements (especially in large doses)Some medicines, including insulin shots, triamterene, and paraldehyde Some diseases that may cause breath odor are: Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG)Acute necrotizing ulcerative mucositisGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)Acute renal failureBowel obstructionBronchiectasisChronic kidney failureEsophageal cancerGastric carcinomaGastrojejunocolic fistulaHepatic encephalopathyDiabetic ketoacidosisLung infection or abscessOzena, or atrophic rhinitisPeriodontal diseasePharyngitisZenker diverticulumHome Care

Use proper dental hygiene, especially flossing. Remember that mouthwashes are not effective in treating the underlying problem. Fresh parsley or a strong mint is often an effective way to fight temporary bad breath. Avoid smoking. Otherwise, follow your health care provider's instructions to treat any underlying cause of bad breath.When to Contact a Medical Professional

How effective are they?Have you had a recent sore throat, sinus infection, tooth abscess, or other illness?What other symptoms do you have?The physical exam will include a thorough inspection of your mouth and nose. A throat culture may be taken if you have a sore throat or mouth sores.In rare cases, tests that may be performed include:Blood tests to screen for diabetes or kidney failureEndoscopy (EGD)X-ray of the abdomenX-ray of the chestAntibiotics may be prescribed for some conditions.

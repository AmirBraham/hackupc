Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.Exposure to glyphosate is not as harmful as exposure to other phosphates. But contact with a very large amount of it can cause severe symptoms. Care will begin by contaminating the person while starting other treatments.The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:Blood and urine tests.Breathing support, including oxygen. They may be placed on a breathing machine with a tube through the mouth into the throat, if needed.Chest x-ray.ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing).Intravenous fluids (through a vein).Medicines to reverse the effects of the poison and treat symptoms.Tube placed down the nose and into the stomach (sometimes).Washing of the skin (irrigation). This may need to be continued for several days.Outlook (Prognosis)

People who continue to improve over the first 4 to 6 hours after receiving medical treatment usually fully recover.Keep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk of poisoning and overdose.Alternative Names

 The common cold most often causes a runny nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing. You may also have a sore throat, cough, headache, or other symptoms.Causes

It is called the common cold for good reason. There are over one billion colds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have more colds than any other type of illness.Colds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children.Children can get many colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares.Colds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons.A cold virus spreads through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose.You can catch a cold if:A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near youYou touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob People are most contagious for the first 2 to 3 days of a cold. A cold is most often not contagious after the first week.Symptoms

Cold symptoms usually start about 2 or 3 days after you came in contact with the virus, although it could take up to a week. Symptoms mostly affect the nose.The most common cold symptoms are:Nasal congestionRunny noseScratchy throatSneezingAdults and older children with colds generally have a low fever or no fever.

Most colds go away in a few days. Some things you can do to take care of yourself with a cold include:Get plenty of rest and drink fluids.Over-the-counter (OTC) cold and cough medicines may help ease symptoms in adults and older children. They do not make your cold go away faster, but can help you feel better.

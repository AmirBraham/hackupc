 Vertebrobasilar circulatory disorders are conditions in which the blood supply to the back of the brain is disrupted.Causes

In the neck, two vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery, which enters the skull. These are the main blood vessels that provide blood flow to the back of the brain. The areas in the back of the brain that receive blood from these arteries are needed to keep a person alive. These areas control breathing, heart rate, swallowing, vision, movement, and posture or balance. All of the nervous system signals that connect the brain to the rest of the body pass through the back of the brain.Many different conditions may reduce or stop blood flow in the back part of the brain. The most common risk factors are smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a high cholesterol level. These are similar to the risk factors for any stroke.Other causes include:Tear in the wall of an arteryBlood clots in the heart that travel to the vertebral or basilar arteries and cause a strokeBlood vessel inflammationConnective tissue diseasesProblems in the spinal bones of the neckOutside pressure on the vertebral or basilar arteries, such as from a salon sink (nicknamed beauty parlor syndrome)Symptoms

Common symptoms may include:Difficulty pronouncing words, slurred speechDifficulty swallowingDouble vision or vision lossNumbness or tingling, most often on the face or scalpSudden falls (drop attacks)Vertigo (sensation of things spinning around)Memory loss Other symptoms may include: Bladder or bowel control problemsDifficulty walking (unsteady gait)Headache, neck acheHearing lossMuscle weaknessNausea and vomitingPain in one or more parts of the body, which gets worse with touch and cold temperaturesPoor coordinationSleepiness or sleep from which the person cannot be awakenedSudden, uncoordinated movementsSweating on the face, arms, or legs Exams and Tests

You may have the following tests, depending on the cause:CT or MRI of the brainComputed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or ultrasound to look at blood vessels in the brainBlood tests, including blood clotting studiesEchocardiogramElectrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitor (24-hour ECG)X-rays of the arteries (angiogram) Treatment

Vertebral or basilar symptoms that start suddenly are a medical emergency that need to be treated right away. Treatment is similar to that for stroke.To treat and prevent the condition, your health care provider may recommend:Taking blood-thinning drugs, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or clopidogrel (Plavix) to lower the risk for strokeChanging your dietMedicine to lower cholesterol and better control blood pressureExercisingLosing weightStopping smoking Invasive procedures or surgery to treat narrowed arteries in this part of the brain are not well studied or proven.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outlook depends on:The amount of brain damageWhat body functions have been affectedHow quickly you get treatmentHow quickly you recover Each person has a different recovery time and need for long-term care. Problems with moving, thinking, and talking often improve in the first weeks or months. Some people will keep improving for months or years.Possible Complications

Complications of vertebrobasilar circulatory disorders are stroke and its complications. These include:Breathing (respiratory) failure (which may require the use of a machine to help the person breathe)Lung problems (especially lung infections)Heart attackLack of fluids in the body (dehydration) and swallowing problems (sometimes requiring tube feeding)Problems with movement or sensation, including paralysis and numbnessFormation of clots in the legsVision loss Complications caused by medicines or surgery may also occur.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call 911 or the local emergency number, or get to the emergency room if you have any symptoms of a vertebral or basilar circulatory disorder.Alternative Names

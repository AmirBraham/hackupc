 Malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon cancerous tumor. It mainly affects the lining of the lung and chest cavity (pleura) or lining of the abdomen (peritoneum). It is due to long-term asbestos exposure.Causes

Long-term exposure to asbestos is the biggest risk factor. Asbestos is a fire-resistant material. It was once commonly found in insulation, ceiling and roofing vinyls, cement, and car brakes. Even though many asbestos workers smoked, experts do not believe smoking itself is a cause of this condition.Older veterans make up 30% of the cases of mesothelioma due to exposure in the military ship, vehicle, and plane industry.Men are affected more often than women. The average age at diagnosis is 60 years. Most people seem to develop the condition about 30 years after being in contact with the asbestos.Symptoms

Symptoms may not appear until 20 to 40 years or longer after exposure to asbestos, and may include:Abdominal bloatingAbdominal painChest pain, especially when taking a deep breath
   Cough
   
   Fatigue
   Shortness of breath
   Weight loss
   Fever and sweatingExams and Tests

The health care provider will do an examination and ask the person about their symptoms and medical history. Tests that may be done include:Chest x-rayChest CT scanCytology of pleural fluidOpen lung biopsyPleural biopsyMesothelioma is often hard to diagnose. Under the microscope, it can be hard to tell this disease apart from similar conditions and tumors.Treatment

Malignant mesothelioma is a difficult cancer to treat.There is usually no cure, unless the disease is found very early and the tumor can be completely removed with surgery. Most of the time, when the disease is diagnosed, it is too advanced for surgery. Chemotherapy or radiation may be used to reduce symptoms. Combining certain chemotherapy drugs may help decrease symptoms, but it will not cure the cancer.Untreated, most people survive about 9 months.Participating in a clinical trial (test of new treatments), may give the person more treatment options.Pain relief, oxygen, and other supportive treatments may also help relieve symptoms.Support Groups

You can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group where members share common experiences and problems.Outlook (Prognosis)

The survival time varies greatly from several months to several years. Outlook depends on:The location of the mesotheliomaThe cell type of the mesotheliomaThe stage of the tumorThe person's age and general healthWhether surgery is an optionThe person's response to treatment You and your family may want to start thinking about end-of-life planning, such as:Palliative careHospice careAdvance care directivesHealth care agentsPossible Complications

 Vomiting blood is regurgitating (throwing up) contents of the stomach that contains blood.Vomited blood may appear bright red, dark red, or look like coffee grounds. The vomited material may be mixed with food or it may be blood only.Considerations

It may be hard to tell the difference between vomiting blood and coughing up blood (from the lung) or a nosebleed.Conditions that cause vomiting blood can also cause blood to appear in the stool.Causes

The upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract includes the mouth, throat, esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach and the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). Blood that is vomited may come from any of these places.Vomiting that is very forceful or continues for a very long time may cause a tear in the small blood vessels of the throat. This may produce streaks of blood in the vomit.Swollen veins in the walls of the lower part of the esophagus, and sometimes the stomach, may begin to bleed. These veins (called varices) may be present in people with severe liver damage.Repeated vomiting and retching may cause bleeding and damage to the lower esophagus called Mallory Weiss tears.Other causes may include:Bleeding ulcer in the stomach, first part of the small intestine, or esophagusBlood clotting disordersDefects in the blood vessels of the GI tractSwelling, irritation, or inflammation of the esophagus lining (esophagitis) or the stomach lining (gastritis)Swallowing blood (for example, after a nosebleed)Tumors of the mouth, throat, stomach or esophagusHome Care

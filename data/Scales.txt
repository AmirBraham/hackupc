After you bathe, pat your skin dry then apply your moisturizer.Bathe only once a day. Take short, warm baths or showers. Limit your time to 5 to 10 minutes. Avoid taking hot baths or showers.Instead of regular soap, try using gentle skin cleansers or soap with added moisturizers.Avoid scrubbing your skin.Drink plenty of water.Try over-the-counter cortisone creams or lotions if your skin is inflamed.If your provider diagnoses you with a skin disorder, such as an inflammatory or fungal disease, follow instructions on home care. This may include using a medicine on your skin. You may also need to take a medicine by mouth.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Laser therapy is a medical treatment that uses a strong beam of light to cut, burn, or destroy tissue. The term LASER stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.Information

The laser light beam does not pose health risks to the person or medical team. Laser treatment has some of the same risks as open surgery, including pain, bleeding, and scarring. But recovery time from laser surgery is usually faster than recovery from open surgery.Lasers can be used for many medical purposes. Because the laser beam is so small and precise, it allows health care providers to safely treat tissue without injuring the surrounding area.Lasers are often used to:Treat varicose veinsImprove vision during eye surgery on the corneaRepair a detached retina of the eyeRemove parts of the prostateRemove kidney stonesRemove tumorsLasers are also often used during skin surgery.

 Bleeding disorders are a group of conditions in which there is a problem with the body's blood clotting process. These disorders can lead to heavy and prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery. Bleeding can also begin on its own and may be difficult to stop.Specific bleeding disorders include:Acquired platelet function defectsCongenital platelet function defectsDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)Prothrombin deficiencyFactor V deficiencyFactor VII deficiencyFactor X deficiencyFactor XI deficiency (hemophilia C)Glanzmann diseaseHemophilia AHemophilia BIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)Von Willebrand disease (types I, II, and III) Causes

Watch this video about:Blood clottingNormal blood clotting involves blood particles, called platelets, and as many as 20 different plasma proteins that layer over the platelets. These proteins are known as blood clotting or coagulation factors. These factors interact with other chemicals to form a substance called fibrin that stops bleeding.Problems can occur when platelets are low in number or do not work properly or when certain coagulation factors are low or missing. Bleeding problems can range from mild to severe.Some bleeding disorders are present at birth and are passed down through families (inherited). Others develop from:Illnesses, such as vitamin K deficiency or severe liver diseaseTreatments, such as the use of drugs to stop blood clots (anticoagulants) or the long-term use of antibiotics Bleeding disorders can also result from a problem with the number or function of platelets. These disorders can also be either inherited or develop later (acquired). The side effects of certain drugs often lead to the acquired forms.Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following: Bleeding into joints or musclesBruising easilyHeavy bleedingHeavy menstrual bleedingNosebleeds that do not stop easilyExcessive bleeding with surgical proceduresUmbilical cord bleeding after birth The problems that occur depend on the specific bleeding disorder, and how severe it is.Exams and Tests

Tests that may be done include:Complete blood count (CBC)Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)Platelet aggregation testProthrombin time (PT)Mixing study, a special PTT test to confirm the factor deficiency Treatment

Treatment depends on the type of disorder. It may include:Clotting factor replacementFresh frozen plasma transfusionPlatelet transfusionOther treatmentsSupport Groups

More information and support for people with bleeding disorders and their families can be found at:National Hemophilia Foundation -- www.hemophilia.org/bleeding-disorders-a-z/types/other-factor-deficienciesNational Hemophilia Foundation -- www.victoryforwomen.org/Outlook (Prognosis)

Outcome also depends on the disorder. Most primary bleeding disorders can be managed. When the disorder is due to diseases, such as DIC, the outcome will depend on how well the underlying disease can be treated.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Bleeding in the brain Severe bleeding (usually from the gastrointestinal tract or injuries) Other complications can occur, depending on the disorder.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if you notice any unusual or severe bleeding.Prevention

Prevention depends on the specific disorder.Alternative Names

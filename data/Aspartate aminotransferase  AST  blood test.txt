 The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) blood test measures the level of the enzyme AST in the blood.How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is needed.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.Why the Test is Performed

AST is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is also found in lesser amounts in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body.Injury to the liver results in release of AST into the blood.This test is mainly done along with other tests (such as ALT, ALP, and bilirubin) to diagnose and monitor liver disease.Normal Results

The normal range is 8 to 33 U/L.Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

An increased AST level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased. An increased AST level may be due to any of the following:Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) Death of liver tissueHeart attackToo much iron in the body (hemochromatosis)Swollen and inflamed liver (hepatitis)Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia)Liver cancer or tumorUse of drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol useMononucleosis ("mono")Muscle disease or traumaSwollen and inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) AST level may also increase after:Burns (deep)Heart proceduresSeizuresSurgeryPregnancy and exercise may also cause an increased AST level.Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:Fainting or feeling lightheadedExcessive bleedingMultiple punctures to locate veinsHematoma (blood collecting under the skin)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)Alternative Names

Aspartate aminotransferase; Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase; SGOTImages

 A toothache is pain in or around a tooth.Considerations

A toothache is often the result of dental cavities (tooth decay) or an infection or irritation of the tooth. Tooth decay is often caused by poor dental hygiene. It may also be partly inherited. In some cases, toothache may be caused due to grinding teeth or other dental trauma. Sometimes, pain that is felt in the tooth is actually due to pain in other parts of the body. This is called referred pain. For example, an earache may sometimes cause tooth pain.Causes

A toothache may occur because of:Abscessed toothEaracheInjury to the jaw or mouthHeart attack (can include jaw pain, neck pain, or toothache)Sinus infectionTooth decayTooth trauma such as wear, injury, or fractureHome Care

You can use over-the-counter pain medicine if you can't see your dentist or primary health care provider right away.Your dentist will first diagnose the source of the pain and recommend treatment. You may be prescribed antibiotics, pain medicines, or other drugs. Use good oral hygiene to prevent tooth decay. A low-sugar diet is recommended along with regular flossing, brushing with fluoride toothpaste, and regular professional cleaning. Sealants and fluoride applications by the dentist are important for preventing tooth decay. Also, tell your dentist if you think you might grind your teeth. When to Contact a Medical Professional

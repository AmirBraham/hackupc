 Alcohol use disorder is when your drinking causes serious problems in your life, yet you keep drinking. You may also need more and more alcohol to feel drunk. Stopping suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms. Causes

No one knows what causes problems with alcohol. Health experts think that it may be a combination of a person's:GenesEnvironmentPsychology, such as being impulsive or having low self-esteemLong-term risks of drinking an excessive amount of alcohol are more likely if:You are a man who has more than 2 drinks per day, or 15 or more drinks a week, or often has 5 or more drinks at a timeYou are a woman who has more than 1 drink per day, or 8 or more drinks a week, or often has 4 or more drinks at a timeOne drink is defined as 12 ounces or 360 milliliters (mL) of beer (5% alcohol content), 5 ounces or 150 mL of wine (12% alcohol content), or a 1.5-ounce or 45-mL shot of liquor (80 proof, or 40% alcohol content).If you have a parent with alcohol use disorder, you are more at risk for alcohol problems.You also may be more likely to have problems with alcohol if you:Are a young adult under peer pressureHave depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or schizophreniaCan easily obtain alcoholHave low self-esteemHave problems with relationshipsLive a stressful lifestyleIf you are concerned about your drinking, it may help to take a careful look at your alcohol use.Symptoms

Health care providers have developed a list of symptoms that a person has to have in the past year to be diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.Symptoms may include:Drinking more or longer than you planned to at timesWanting to or trying to cut down or stop drinking, but could notSpending a lot of time and effort to get alcohol, use it, or recover from its effectsCraving alcohol or having a strong urge to use itMissing work or school, or not performing as well because of drinkingContinuing to drink, even when it harms your relationships with family and friendsNo longer taking part in activities that you used to enjoyGetting into situations that can cause you to get hurt, such as driving, using machinery, or having unsafe sex while or after drinkingContinuing to drink, even though it is making a health problem caused by alcohol worseNeeding more and more alcohol to feel its effects or to get drunk (this is called tolerance)Getting withdrawal symptoms when the effects of alcohol wear offExams and Tests

Your provider will:Examine youAsk about your medical and family historyAsk about your alcohol use, and if you have any of the symptoms listed above Your provider may order tests to check for health problems that are common in people who use alcohol. These tests may include:Blood alcohol level (This shows if you have recently been drinking alcohol. It does not diagnose alcohol use disorder.)Complete blood countLiver function testsMagnesium blood testTreatment

Many people with an alcohol problem need to completely stop using alcohol. This is called abstinence. Having strong social and family support can help make it easier to quit drinking.Some people are able to just cut back on their drinking. So even if you do not totally give up alcohol, you may be able to drink less. This can improve your health and relationships with others. It can also help you perform better at work or school.However, many people who drink too much find they can't just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem.DECIDING TO QUITLike many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of your control. An important first step is to be aware of how much you drink. It also helps to understand the health risks of alcohol.If you decide to quit drinking, talk with your provider. Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives of those around you.Depending on how much and how long you have been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a provider. Talk with your provider about how to stop using alcohol.LONG-TERM SUPPORTAlcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer:Education about alcohol use and its effectsCounseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviorsPhysical health careFor the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems. Depending on your needs and the programs that are available:You may be treated in a special recovery center (inpatient)You may attend a program while you live at home (outpatient)You may be prescribed medicines along with counseling and behavioral therapy to help you quit. This is called medication-assisted treatment (MAT). While MAT doesn't work for everyone, it is another option in treating the disorder. These medicines are often used for MAT.Acamprosate helps reduce cravings and dependence on alcohol in people who have recently stopped drinking.Disulfiram should only be used after you stop drinking. It causes a very bad reaction when you drink, which helps prevent you from drinking.Naltrexone blocks pleasurable feelings of intoxication, which may help you cut back or stop drinking.It's a common misconception that taking medicine to treat alcohol use disorder is trading one addiction for another. These medicines are not addictive. They can help some people manage the disorder, just as people with diabetes or heart disease take medicine to treat their condition.Drinking may mask depression or other mood or anxiety disorders. If you have a mood disorder, it may become more noticeable when you stop drinking. Your provider will treat any mental disorders in addition to your alcohol treatment.Drinking significantly may also cause depression and anxiety. You need to stop drinking for at least a month to see if these symptoms get better and do not need further treatment.Support Groups

Support groups help many people who are dealing with alcohol use. Talk to your provider about a support group that might be right for you.Outlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on whether they can successfully cut back or stop drinking. It may take several tries to stop drinking for good. If you are struggling to quit, do not give up hope. Getting treatment, if needed, along with support and encouragement from support groups and those around you can help you remain sober. Possible Complications

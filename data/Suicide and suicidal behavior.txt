Many who attempt suicide are seeking relief from:Feeling ashamed, guilty, or like a burden to othersFeeling like a victimFeelings of rejection, loss, or lonelinessSuicidal behaviors may occur when there is a situation or event that the person finds overwhelming, such as:Aging (older people have the highest rate of suicide)Death of a loved oneDrug or alcohol useEmotional traumaSerious physical illness or painUnemployment or money problems Risk factors for suicide in teenagers include:Access to gunsFamily member who completed suicideHistory of hurting themselves on purposeHistory of being neglected or abusedLiving in communities where there have been recent outbreaks of suicide in young peopleRomantic breakupWhile men are more likely than women to die by suicide, women are twice as likely to attempt suicide.Most suicide attempts do not result in death. Many of these attempts are done in a way that makes rescue possible. These attempts are often a cry for help.Some people attempt suicide in a way that is less likely to be fatal, such as poisoning or overdose. Men are more likely to choose violent methods, such as shooting themselves. As a result, suicide attempts by men are more likely to result in death.Relatives of people who attempt or complete suicide often blame themselves or become very angry. They may see the suicide attempt as selfish. However, people who attempt suicide often mistakenly believe that they are doing their friends and relatives a favor by taking themselves out of the world.Symptoms

Often, but not always, a person may show certain signs and behaviors before a suicide attempt, such as:Having trouble concentrating or thinking clearlyGiving away belongingsTalking about going away or the need to "get my affairs in order"Suddenly changing behavior, especially calmness after a period of anxietyLosing interest in activities they used to enjoySelf-destructive behaviors, such as heavily drinking alcohol, using illegal drugs, or cutting their bodyPulling away from friends or not wanting to go outSuddenly having trouble in school or workTalking about death or suicide, or even saying that they want to hurt themselvesTalking about feeling hopeless or guiltyChanging sleep or eating habitsArranging ways to take their own life (such as buying a gun or many pills)Treatment

People who are at risk of suicidal behavior may not seek treatment for many reasons, including:They believe nothing will help.They do not want to tell anyone they have problems.They think asking for help is a sign of weakness.They do not know where to go for help.They believe their loved ones would be better off without them.A person may need emergency treatment after a suicide attempt. They may need first aid, CPR, or more intensive treatments.People who try to take their own life may need to stay in a hospital for treatment and to reduce the risk of future attempts. Therapy is one of the most important parts of treatment.Any mental health disorder that may have led to the suicide attempt should be evaluated and treated. This includes:
  Bipolar disorder

Contact a health care provider right away if you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide. The person needs mental health care right away. DO NOT dismiss the person as just trying to get attention.Prevention

Avoiding alcohol and drugs (other than prescribed medicines) can reduce the risk of suicide.In homes with children or teenagers:Keep all prescription medicines high up and locked.Do not keep alcohol in the home, or keep it locked up.Do not keep guns in the home. If you do keep guns in the home, lock them and keep the bullets separate.
   In older adults, further investigate feelings of hopelessness, being a burden, and not belonging.Many people who try to take their own life talk about it before making the attempt. Sometimes, just talking to someone who cares and who does not judge them is enough to reduce the risk of suicide.However, if you are a friend, family member, or you know someone who you think may attempt suicide, never try to manage the problem on your own. Seek help. Suicide prevention centers have telephone "hotline" services.Never ignore a suicide threat or attempted suicide.Alternative Names

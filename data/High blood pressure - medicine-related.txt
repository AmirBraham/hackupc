 Drug-induced hypertension is high blood pressure caused by a chemical substance or medicine.Causes

Blood pressure is determined by the:Amount of blood the heart pumpsCondition of the heart valvesPulse ratePumping power of the heartSize and condition of the arteries There are several types of high blood pressure:Essential hypertension has no cause that can be found (many different genetic traits contribute to essential hypertension, each one having a relatively small effect).Secondary hypertension occurs because of another disorder.Drug-induced hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension caused by a response to a chemical substance or medicine.Pregnancy-induced hypertension.Chemical substances and medicines that can cause high blood pressure include:AcetaminophenAlcohol, amphetamines, ecstasy (MDMA and derivatives), and cocaineAngiogenesis inhibitors (including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies)Antidepressants (including venlafaxine, bupropion, and desipramine)Black licoriceCaffeine (including the caffeine in coffee and energy drinks)Corticosteroids and mineralocorticoidsEphedra and many other herbal productsErythropoietinEstrogens (including birth control pills)Immunosuppressants (such as cyclosporine)Many over-the-counter medicines such as cough/cold and asthma medicines, particularly when the cough/cold medicine is taken with certain antidepressants, such as tranylcypromine or tricyclicsMigraine medicinesNasal decongestantsNicotineNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)Phentermine (a weight loss medicine)Testosterone and other anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing drugsThyroid hormone (when taken in excess)Yohimbine (and Yohimbe extract)Rebound hypertension occurs when blood pressure rises after you stop taking or lower the dose of a drug (typically a medicine to lower high blood pressure).This is common for medicines that block the sympathetic nervous system like beta blockers and clonidine.Talk to your health care provider to see if your medicine needs to be gradually tapered before stopping.Many other factors can also affect blood pressure, including:AgeCondition of the kidneys, nervous system, or blood vesselsGeneticsFoods eaten, weight, and other body-related variables, including the amount of added sodium in processed foodsLevels of various hormones in the bodyVolume of water in the body Alternative Names

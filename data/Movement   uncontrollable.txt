There are many causes of uncontrolled movements. Some movements last only a short time. Others are due to a permanent condition of the brain and spinal cord and may get worse.Some of these movements affect children. Others affect only adults.Causes in children:Genetic disorderKernicterus (too much bilirubin in the central nervous system after birth)Lack of oxygen (hypoxia) at birth Causes in adults:Nervous system diseasesGenetic disorderMedicinesStroke or brain injuryTumors Illicit drugsHead and neck traumaHome Care

Physical therapy that includes swimming, stretching, walking, and balancing exercises can help with coordination and slow the damage. A home safety evaluation by a physical therapist may be helpful.Take measures to make it easier and safer to move around at home. For example, get rid of clutter, leave wide walkways, and remove throw rugs or other objects that might cause slipping or falling. Make sure there is enough lighting at night.People with this condition should be encouraged to take part in normal activities. Family members need to be patient with a person who has poor coordination. Take time to show the person ways to do tasks more easily. Take advantage of the person's strengths while avoiding their weaknesses.Ask the health care provider whether walking aids, such as a cane or walker, would be helpful.People with this disorder are prone to falls.

Self-help groups are available in many communities.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Sclerosing cholangitis refers to swelling (inflammation), scarring, and destruction of the bile ducts inside and outside of the liver.Causes

The cause of this condition is unknown in most cases.The disease may be seen in people who have:Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn diseaseAutoimmune disordersChronic pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas)Sarcoidosis (a disease that causes inflammation in various parts of the body)Genetic factors may also be responsible. Sclerosing cholangitis occurs more often in men than women. This disorder is rare in children.Sclerosing cholangitis may also be caused by:Choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the bile duct)Infections in the liver, gallbladder, and bile ductsSymptoms

The first symptoms are usually:FatigueItchingYellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) However, some people have no symptoms.Other symptoms may include:Enlarged liverEnlarged spleenLoss of appetite and weight lossRepeat episodes of cholangitis (an infection of the bile duct that causes fever, jaundice and pain in the right upper abdomen)Exams and Tests

Even though some people do not have symptoms, blood tests shows that they have abnormal liver function. Your health care provider will look for:Diseases that cause similar problemsDiseases that often occur with this condition (especially IBD)GallstonesTests that show cholangitis include:Abdominal CT scanAbdominal ultrasoundEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)Liver biopsyMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC)Blood tests for liver enzymes (liver function tests)Treatment

Medicines that may be used include:Cholestyramine (such as Prevalite) to treat itchingUrsodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) to improve liver functionFat-soluble vitamins (D, E, A, K) to replace what is lost from the disease itselfAntibiotics to treat infections in the bile ductsThese surgical procedures may be done:Inserting a long, thin tube with a balloon at the end to open up narrowing (endoscopic balloon dilation of strictures)Placement of a drain or tube for major narrowing (strictures) of bile ductsProctocolectomy (removal of colon and rectum, for those who have both ulcerative colitis and sclerosing cholangitis)Â does not affect the progression of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)Liver transplantOutlook (Prognosis)

How well people do varies. The disease tends to get worse over time. Sometimes people develop:Ascites (buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and abdominal organs) and varices in the esophagus or stomach (enlarged veins)Biliary cirrhosis (liver scarring due to inflammation of the bile ducts)Liver failurePersistent jaundiceSome people develop infections of the bile ducts that keep returning.People with this condition have a high risk for developing cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma). They should be checked regularly with a liver imaging test and blood tests. People who also have IBD may have an increased risk for developing cancer of the colon or rectum and should have periodic colonoscopy.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Bleeding esophageal varicesCancer in the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma)Cirrhosis and liver failureInfection of the biliary system (cholangitis)Narrowing of the bile ductsVitamin deficiencies Alternative Names

 Nipple discharge is any fluid that comes out of the nipple area in your breast.Causes

Sometimes discharge from your nipples is OK and will get better on its own. You are more likely to have nipple discharge if you have been pregnant at least once.Nipple discharge is most often not due to cancer (thus a benign condition), but rarely, it can be a sign of breast cancer. It is important to find out what is causing it and to get treatment. Here are some reasons for nipple discharge:PregnancyRecent breastfeedingRubbing on the area from a bra or t-shirtInjury to the breastBreast infectionInflammation and clogging of the breast ductsNoncancerous pituitary tumorsSmall growth in the breast that is usually not cancerSevere underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)Fibrocystic breast (normal lumpiness in the breast)Use of certain medicines such as birth control pills or antidepressantsUse of certain herbs, such as anise, blessed thistle, and fennelWidening of the milk ducts Intraductal papilloma (benign tumor in the milk duct)Chronic kidney diseaseIllicit drug use, including cocaine, opioids and marijuanaSometimes, babies can have nipple discharge. This is caused by hormones from the mother before birth. It should go away in 2 weeks.Cancers such as Paget disease (a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple) can also cause nipple discharge.Symptoms

Nipple discharge that is not normal is:BloodyComes from only one nippleComes out on its own without you squeezing or touching your nipple Nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it:Comes out of both nipplesHappens when you squeeze your nipples The color of the discharge does not tell you whether it is normal. The discharge can look milky, clear, yellow, green, or brown.Squeezing your nipple to check for discharge can make it worse. Leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine you and ask questions about your symptoms and medical history.Tests that may be done include:Prolactin blood testThyroid blood testsHead CT scan or MRI to look for pituitary tumorMammographyUltrasound of the breastBreast biopsyDuctography or ductogram: an x-ray with contrast dye injected into the affected milk ductSkin biopsy, if Paget disease is a concern Treatment

You may:Need to change any medicine that caused the dischargeHave lumps removedHave all or some of the breast ducts removedReceive creams to treat skin changes around your nippleReceive medicines to treat aÂ health condition If all of your tests are normal, you may not need treatment. You should have another mammogram and physical exam within 1 year.Outlook (Prognosis)

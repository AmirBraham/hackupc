This holds the vaginal canal open. Numbing medicine may be applied to the opening to the uterus (cervix).The cervical canal is widened, and a curette (a metal loop on the end of a long, thin handle) is passed through the opening into the uterus cavity. The provider gently scrapes the inner layer of tissue, called the endometrium. The tissue is collected for examination.Why the Procedure is Performed

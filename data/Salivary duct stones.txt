 Salivary duct stones are deposits of minerals in the ducts that drain the salivary glands. Salivary duct stones are a type of salivary gland disorder. Causes

Spit (saliva) is produced by the salivary glands in the mouth. The chemicals in saliva can form a hard crystal that can block the salivary ducts. When saliva cannot exit a blocked duct, it backs up into the gland. This may cause pain, swelling, or an infection of the gland. There are three pairs of major salivary glands:Parotid glands -- These are the two largest glands. One is located in each cheek over the jaw in front of the ears. Inflammation of one or more of these glands is called parotitis, or parotiditis. Submandibular glands -- These two glands are located just under both sides of the jaw and carry saliva up to the floor of mouth under the tongue.Sublingual glands -- These two glands are located just under the front area of the floor of the mouth.Salivary stones most often affect the submandibular glands. They can also affect the parotid glands. Symptoms

Symptoms include:Problems opening the mouth or swallowingDry mouthPain in the face or mouthSwelling of the face or neck (can be severe when eating or drinking) The symptoms occur most often when eating or drinking.Exams and Tests

The health care provider or dentist will do an exam of your head and neck to look for one or more enlarged, tender salivary glands. The provider may be able to find the stone during the exam by feeling under your tongue.Tests such as x-rays, ultrasound, MRI scan, or CT scan of the face are used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment

The goal is to remove the stone. Steps you can take at home include: Drinking lots of waterUsing sugar-free lemon drops to increase the amount of salivaOther ways to remove the stone are:Massaging the gland with heat -- The provider or dentist may be able to push the stone out of the duct. In some cases, you may need surgery to cut out the stone. A newer treatment that uses shock waves to break the stone into small pieces is another option.A technique called sialendoscopy, can diagnose and treat stones in the salivary gland duct using very small cameras and instruments.If stones become infected or come back often, you may need surgery to remove the salivary gland. Outlook (Prognosis)

Most of the time, salivary duct stones cause only pain or discomfort, but at times become infected. When to Contact a Medical Professional

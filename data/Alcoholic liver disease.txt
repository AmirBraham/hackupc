 Alcoholic liver disease is damage to the liver and its function due to alcohol abuse.Causes

Alcoholic liver disease most often occurs after years of heavy drinking. Over time, scarring and cirrhosis can occur. Cirrhosis is the final phase of alcoholic liver disease.Alcoholic liver disease does not occur in all heavy drinkers. The chances of getting liver disease go up the longer you have been drinking and more alcohol you consume. You do not have to get drunk for the disease to happen.The disease is most common in people between 40 and 50 years of age. Men are more likely to have this problem. However, women may develop the disease after less exposure to alcohol than men. Some people may have an inherited risk for the disease.Symptoms

There may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly. This depends on how well the liver is working. Symptoms tend to be worse after a period of heavy drinking.Early symptoms include:Loss of energyPoor appetite and weight lossNauseaBelly painSmall, red spider-like blood vessels on the skinAs liver function worsens, symptoms may include:Fluid buildup of the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites)Yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes (jaundice)Redness on the palms of the handsIn men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swellingEasy bruising and abnormal bleedingConfusion or problems thinkingPale or clay-colored stoolsBleeding in the gastrointestinal tractExams and Tests

Alcoholic liver disease is treatable if it is caught before it causes severe damage. However, continued excessive drinking can shorten your lifespan.Cirrhosis further worsens the condition and can lead to serious complications. In case of severe damage, the liver cannot heal or return to normal function.Possible Complications

Limited range of motion is a term meaning that a joint or body part cannot move through its normal range of motion.Considerations

Motion may be limited because of a problem within the joint, swelling of tissue around the joint, stiffness of the ligaments and muscles, or pain.Causes

A sudden loss of range of motion may be due to:Dislocation of a jointFracture of an elbow or other jointInfected joint (hip is most common in children)Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (in boys 4 to 10 years old)Nursemaid elbow, an injury to the elbow joint in young childrenTearing of certain structures within the joint, such as the meniscus or cartilageLose bodies which have become stuck in the jointLoss of motion may occur if you damage the bones within a joint. This may happen if you have:Broken a joint bone in the pastFrozen shoulderOsteoarthritisRheumatoid arthritisAnkylosing spondylitis (chronic form of arthritis)Brain, nerve, or muscle disorders can damage the nerves, tendons, and muscles, and can cause loss of motion.

 Legionnaires disease is an infection of the lungs and airways. It is caused by Legionella bacteria.Causes

The bacteria that cause Legionnaires disease have been found in water delivery systems. They can survive in the warm, moist air conditioning systems of large buildings, including hospitals.Most cases are caused by the bacteria Legionella pneumophila. The rest of the cases are caused by other Legionella species.Spread of the bacteria from person to person has not been proven.Most infections occur in middle-aged or older people. In rare cases, children can get the infection. When they do, the disease is less severe.Risk factors include:Alcohol useCigarette smokingChronic illnesses, such as kidney failure or diabetesLong-term (chronic) lung disease, such as COPDLong-term use of a breathing machine (ventilator)Medicines that suppress the immune system, including chemotherapy and steroid drugsOlder age Symptoms

Symptoms tend to get worse during the first 4 to 6 days. They most often improve in another 4 to 5 days.Symptoms may include:General discomfort, loss of energy, or ill feeling (malaise)HeadacheFever, shaking chillsJoint pain, muscle aches and stiffnessChest painCough that does not produce much sputum or mucus (dry cough)Coughing up blood (rare)Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain Shortness of breathExams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Abnormal sounds, called crackles, may be heard when listening to the chest with a stethoscope.Tests that may be done include:Arterial blood gasesBlood cultures or other tests to identify the bacteriaBronchoscopy to view the airways and diagnose lung diseaseChest x-ray or CT scanComplete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell countLiver blood testsTests and cultures on sputum to identify Legionella bacteriaUrine tests to check for Legionella pneumophila bacteriaMolecular tests with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Treatment

Antibiotics are used to fight the infection. Treatment is started as soon as Legionnaire disease is suspected, without waiting for results of any lab test.Other treatments may include receiving:Fluids through a vein (IV) Oxygen, which is given through a mask or breathing machineMedicines that are breathed in to ease breathingOutlook (Prognosis)

Legionnaires disease can be life threatening. The risk of dying is higher in people who:Have long-term (chronic) diseases or compromised immune systemsBecome infected while in the hospitalAre older adultsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

 Livedo reticularis (LR) is a skin symptom. It refers to a netlike pattern of reddish-blue skin discoloration. The legs are often affected. The condition is linked to swollen blood vessels. It may get worse when the temperature is cold.Causes

 As blood flows through the body, arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. The skin discoloration pattern of LR results from veins in the skin that are filled with more blood than normal. This can be caused by any of the following:Enlarged veinsBlocked blood flow leaving the veinsThere are two forms of LR: primary and secondary. Secondary LR is also known as livedo racemosa.With primary LR, exposure to cold, tobacco use, or emotional upset can lead the skin discoloration. Women 20 to 50 years old are most often affected.Many different diseases are associated with secondary LR, including:Congenital (present at birth)As a reaction to certain medicines such as amantadine or interferonOther blood vessel diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa and Raynaud phenomenonDiseases that involve the blood such as abnormal proteins or high risk of developing blood clots such as antiphospholipid syndromeInfections such as hepatitis CParalysisSymptoms

In most cases, LR affects the legs. Sometimes, the face, trunk, buttocks, hands and feet are involved as well. Usually, there is no pain. However, if blood flow is completely blocked, pain and skin ulcers can develop.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms.Blood tests or a skin biopsy may be done to help diagnose any underlying health problem.Treatment

 For primary LR:Keeping warm, especially the legs, may help relieve the skin discoloration.Do not smoke.Avoid stressful situations.If you are uncomfortable with the appearance of your skin, talk to your provider about treatment, such as taking medicines that can help with the skin discoloration.For secondary LR, treatment depends on the underlying disease.

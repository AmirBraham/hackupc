 Esophagitis is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus becomes swollen, inflamed, or irritated. The esophagus is the tube that leads from your mouth to the stomach. It is also called the food pipe.Causes

Esophagitis is often caused by stomach fluid that flows back into the food pipe. The fluid contains acid, which irritates the esophageal lining. This problem is called gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). An autoimmune disorder called eosinophilic esophagitis also causes this condition.The following increase your risk for this condition:Alcohol useCigarette smokingSurgery or radiation to the chest (for example, treatment for lung cancer)Taking certain medicines such as alendronate, doxycycline, ibandronate, risedronate, tetracycline, potassium tablets, and vitamin C, without drinking plenty of waterVomitingLying down after eating a large meal ObesityPeople who have a weakened immune system may develop infections. Infections may lead to swelling of the food pipe. Infection may be due to:Fungi or yeast (most often Candida)Viruses, such as herpes or cytomegalovirusSymptoms

The infection or irritation may cause the food pipe to become inflamed. Sores called ulcers may form. Symptoms may include:CoughDifficulty swallowingPainful swallowingHeartburn (acid reflux)HoarsenessSore throat Exams and Tests

The doctor may perform the following tests:Esophageal manometryEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), removing a piece of tissue from the food pipe for examination (biopsy)Upper GI series (barium swallow x-ray) Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause. Common treatment options are: Medicines that reduce stomach acid in case of reflux diseaseAntibiotics to treat infectionsMedicines and diet changes to treat eosinophilic esophagitisMedicines to coat the lining of the food pipe to treat damage related to pillsYou should stop taking medicines that damage the lining of the esophagus. Take your pills with plenty of water. Avoid lying down immediately after taking the pill.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most of the time, the disorders that cause swelling and inflammation of the food pipe, respond to treatment.Possible Complications

If not treated, this condition may cause severe discomfort. Scarring (stricture) of the food pipe may develop. This can cause swallowing problems. A condition called Barrett esophagus (BE) can develop after years of GERD. Rarely, BE may lead to cancer of the food pipe.When to Contact a Medical Professional

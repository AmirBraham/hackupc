 Diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a complication of type 2 diabetes. It involves extremely high blood sugar (glucose) level without the presence of ketones.Causes

HHS is a condition of:Extremely high blood sugar (glucose) level
 
 Extreme lack of water (dehydration)
 
 Decreased alertness or consciousness (in many cases)
 Buildup of ketones in the body (ketoacidosis) may also occur. But it is unusual and is often mild compared with diabetic ketoacidosis. HHS is more often seen in people with type 2 diabetes who don't have their diabetes under control. It may also occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes. The condition may be brought on by:InfectionOther illness, such as heart attack or strokeMedicines that decrease the effect of insulin in the bodyMedicines or conditions that increase fluid lossRunning out of, or not taking prescribed diabetes medicinesNormally, the kidneys try to make up for a high glucose level in the blood by allowing the extra glucose to leave the body in the urine. But this also causes the body to lose water. If you do not drink enough water, or you drink fluids that contain sugar and keep eating foods with carbohydrates, you become very dehydrated. When this occurs, the kidneys are no longer able to get rid of the extra glucose. As a result, the glucose level in your blood can become very high, sometimes more than 10 times the normal amount.The loss of water also makes the blood more concentrated than normal. This is called hyperosmolarity. It is a condition in which the blood has a high concentration of salt (sodium), glucose, and other substances. This draws the water out of the body's other organs, including the brain.Risk factors include:
 A stressful event such as infection, heart attack, stroke, or recent surgery
 Heart failureImpaired thirstLimited access to water (especially in people with dementia or who are bedbound)
 Older age
 
 Poor kidney function
 
 Poor management of diabetes, not following the treatment plan as directed
 
 Stopping or running out of insulin or other medicines that lower glucose level
 Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Increased thirst and urination (at the beginning of the syndrome)Feeling weakNauseaWeight lossDry mouth, dry tongueFeverSeizuresConfusionComaSymptoms may get worse over days or weeks.Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:Loss of feeling or function of musclesProblems with movementSpeech impairment Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and medical history. The exam may show that you have:Extreme dehydrationFever higher than 100.4°F (38°C)Increased heart rateLow systolic blood pressure Test that may be done include:Blood osmolarity (concentration)BUN and creatinine levelsBlood sodium level (needs to be adjusted for the blood glucose level)Ketone testBlood glucose, potassium, and bicarbonateEvaluation for possible causes may include:Blood and urine culturesChest x-rayElectrocardiogram (ECG)UrinalysisCovid-19 and influenza testingCT of the headTreatment

At the start of treatment, the goal is to correct the water loss. This will improve the blood pressure, urine output, and circulation. Blood sugar will also decrease.Fluids and potassium will be given through a vein (intravenously). This must be done carefully. High glucose level is treated with insulin given through a vein.Outlook (Prognosis)

People who develop HHS are often already ill. If not treated right away, seizures, coma, or death may result.Possible Complications

Untreated, HHS may lead to any of the following:ShockBlood clot formationBrain swelling (cerebral edema)Increased blood acid level (lactic acidosis)When to Contact a Medical Professional

This condition is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you develop symptoms of HHS.Prevention

Controlling type 2 diabetes and recognizing the early signs of dehydration and infection can help prevent HHS. Have a "sick-day plan" so you will be prepared for days when you are not going to be eating well. Also try to order your diabetes and other medicines in 3-month amounts so you will be less likely to run out of them.Alternative Names

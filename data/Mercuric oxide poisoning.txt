The health care provider will measure and monitor vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator)Blood and urine testsCamera down the throat (endoscopy) to see burns in the food pipe (esophagus) and stomachChest x-rayECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)Fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV)Medicines to treat symptomsMedicines called chelators that remove mercury from the bloodstream and tissues, which may reduce long-term injury Any person who swallowed a battery will need immediate x-rays to make sure the battery is not stuck in the esophagus. Most swallowed batteries that pass through the esophagus will pass out of the body in the stool without complication. However, batteries stuck in the esophagus can cause a hole in the esophagus very quickly, leading to serious infection and shock, which may be fatal. It is very important to seek immediate medical help after a battery is swallowed. Outlook (Prognosis)

This substance is very poisonous. How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed, what symptoms occur within the first 10 to 15 minutes after swallowing it, and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Kidney dialysis (filtration) through a machine may be needed if the kidneys do not recover after acute mercury poisoning. Kidney failure and death can occur, even from small doses.If the poisoning has occurred slowly over time, any brain damage may be permanent.Mercuric oxide poisoning can lead to multiple organ failure and death.References

 Excessive amount of urination means that your body makes larger than normal amounts of urine each day. Causes

An excessive volume of urination for an adult is more than 2.5 liters (about 67 fluid ounces or about 2.6 quarts) of urine per day. However, this can vary depending on how much water you drink and what your total body water is. This problem is different from needing to urinate often.Polyuria is a fairly common symptom. People often notice the problem when they have to get up during the night to use the toilet (nocturia).Some common causes of the problems are:Diabetes insipidusDiabetes mellitusDrinking excessive amounts of waterLess common causes include: Kidney failureMedicines such as diuretics and lithiumHigh or low calcium level in the bodyDrinking alcohol and caffeineSickle cell anemiaAlso, your urine production may increase for 24 hours after having tests that involve injecting a special dye (contrast medium) into your vein during imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI scan.Home Care

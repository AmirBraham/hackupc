Pityriasis rosea is believed to be caused by a virus. It occurs most often in the fall and spring.Although pityriasis rosea may occur in more than one person in a household at a time, it is not thought to spread from one person to another. Females seem to be more affected than males.Symptoms

Your health care provider can often diagnose pityriasis rosea by the way the rash looks.In rare cases, the following tests are needed:

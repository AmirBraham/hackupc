 A stingray is a sea animal with a whip-like tail. The tail has sharp spines that contain venom. This article describes the effects of a stingray sting. Stingrays are the most common group of fish that sting humans. Twenty-two species of stingrays are found in US coastal waters, 14 in the Atlantic and 8 in the Pacific.This article is for information only.

Seek medical help right away. Some stingray stings can be serious and require professional care.For superficial stings to an arm or leg, while waiting for medical help, you can provide initial treatment to help alleviate pain and prevent infection:Immediately get out of the water and into a safe environment.Control bleeding (if any) by applying direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage.Next soak the wound with hot water. Immerse the affected area in water at 40 to 45 degrees Celsius, or if no thermometer is onsite, then as hot as can be comfortably tolerated on an unaffected limb. Soak the wound for 30 to not longer than 90 minutes, periodically checking the water temperature to maintain its warmth.After soaking, gently wash the wound with mild soap and clean water to remove any dirt, debris, or venom that may be present.If not allergic, apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment.Cover the wound using a sterile bandage or a sterile non-stick dressing with tape.Before Calling Emergency

The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The wound will be soaked in a cleaning solution and any remaining debris will be removed. Symptoms will be treated. Some or all of these procedures may be performed:Blood and urine testsBreathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine (ventilator)ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)Intravenous fluids (IV, through a vein)Medicine called an antiserum to reverse the effect of the venomMedicine to treat symptomsX-rays Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome often depends on how much venom entered the body, the location of the sting, and how soon the person receives treatment. Numbness or tingling may last for several weeks after the sting. Deep stinger penetration may require surgery for removal. Skin breakdown from the venom is sometimes severe enough to require surgery. A puncture in the person's chest or abdomen may lead to death.References

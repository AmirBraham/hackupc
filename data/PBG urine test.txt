 Porphobilinogen (PBG) is one of several types of porphyrins found in your body. Porphyrins help form many important substances in the body. One of these is hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen in the blood. Porphyrins usually leave your body through urine or stools. If this process does not occur, porphyrins such as PBG can build up in your body.This article describes the test to measure the amount of PBG in a urine sample.How the Test is Performed

After you provide a urine sample, it is tested in the lab. This is called a random urine sample. If needed, your health care provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. This is called a 24-hour urine sample. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.How to Prepare for the Test

Your provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking medicines that may affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include:Antibiotics and anti-fungal drugsAnti-anxiety drugsBirth control pillsDiabetes medicinesPain medicinesSleep medicines Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.How the Test will Feel

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

 Palpitations are feelings or sensations that your heart is pounding or racing. They can be felt in your chest, throat, or neck.You may:Have an unpleasant awareness of your own heartbeatFeel like your heart skipped or stopped beats The heart's rhythm may be normal or abnormal when you have palpitations.Considerations

Normally the heart beats 60 to 100 times per minute. The rate may drop below 60 beats per minute in people who exercise routinely or take medicines that slow the heart. If your heart rate is fast (over 100 beats per minute), this is called tachycardia. A heart rate slower than 60 is called bradycardia. An occasional extra heartbeat out of rhythm is known as extrasystole.Palpitations are not serious most of the time. Sensations representing an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) may be more serious.The following conditions make you more likely to have an abnormal heart rhythm: Known heart disease at the time the palpitations beginSignificant risk factors for heart diseaseAn abnormal heart valveAn electrolyte abnormality in your blood -- for example, a low potassium level Causes

Heart palpitations can be due to:Anxiety, stress, panic attack, or fearCaffeine intakeCocaine, methamphetamine or other stimulant drugsDecongestant medications, such as phenylephrine or pseudoephedrineDiet pillsExerciseFeverNicotine intakeHowever, some palpitations are due to an abnormal heart rhythm, which may be caused by:Heart diseaseAbnormal heart valve, such as mitral valve prolapseAbnormal blood level of potassiumCertain medicines, including those used to treat asthma, high blood pressure, or heart problemsOveractive thyroidLow level of oxygen in your blood Home Care

Things you can do to limit palpitations include: Lower your intake of caffeine and nicotine. This will often reduce heart palpitations.Learn to reduce stress and anxiety. This can help prevent palpitations and help you better manage them when they occur.Try deep relaxation or breathing exercises.Practice yoga, meditation, or tai chi.Get regular exercise.Do not smoke. Once a serious cause has been ruled out by your provider, try not to pay close attention to heart palpitations. This may cause stress. However, contact your provider if you notice a sudden increase or a change in them. When to Contact a Medical Professional

Your provider will examine you and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms.You may be asked:Do you feel skipped or stopped beats?Does your heart rate feel slow or fast when you have the palpitations?Do you feel a racing, pounding, or fluttering?Is there a regular or irregular pattern to the unusual heartbeat sensations?Did the palpitations begin or end suddenly?When do the palpitations occur? In response to reminders of a traumatic event? When you are lying down and resting? When you change your body position? When you feel emotional?Do you have any other symptoms? An electrocardiogram may be done.If you go to an emergency room, you will be connected to a heart monitor.

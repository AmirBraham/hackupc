 Ulnar nerve dysfunction is a problem with one of the nerves that travel from the shoulder to the hand, called the ulnar nerve. It helps you move your arm, wrist, and hand.Causes

Damage to one nerve group, such as the ulnar nerve, is called mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy means there is damage to a single nerve. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.Causes of mononeuropathy include:An illness in the whole body that damages a single nerveDirect injury to the nerveLong-term pressure on the nervePressure on the nerve caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures Ulnar neuropathy is also common in those with diabetes.Ulnar neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the ulnar nerve. This nerve travels down the arm to the wrist, hand, and ring and little fingers. It passes just under the surface of the skin near the elbow. So, bumping the nerve there causes the pain and tingling of "hitting the funny bone."When the nerve compressed in the elbow, a problem called cubital tunnel syndrome may result.When damage destroys the nerve covering (myelin sheath) or part of the nerve itself, nerve signaling is slowed or prevented.Damage to the ulnar nerve can be caused by:Long-term pressure on the elbow or base of the palmAn elbow fracture or dislocationRepeated elbow bending, such as with cigarette smoking In some cases, no cause can be found.Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Abnormal sensations in the little finger and part of the ring finger, usually on the palm sideWeakness, loss of coordination of the fingersClaw-like deformity of the hand and wrist
 Pain, numbness, decreased sensation, tingling, or burning sensation in the areas controlled by the nervePain or numbness may awaken you from sleep. Activities such as tennis or golf may make the condition worse.Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may be asked what you were doing before the symptoms started.Tests that may be needed include:Blood testsImaging tests, such as MRI to view the nerve and nearby structuresNerve conduction tests to check how fast nerve signals travelElectromyography (EMG) to check the health of the ulnar nerve and the muscles it controlsNerve biopsy to examine a piece of nerve tissue (rarely needed) Treatment

The goal of treatment is to allow you to use the hand and arm as much as possible. Your provider will find and treat the cause, if possible. Sometimes, no treatment is needed and you will get better on your own.If medicines are needed, they may include:Over-the-counter or prescription medicines (such as gabapentin and pregabalin)Corticosteroid injections around the nerve to reduce swelling and pressureYour provider will likely suggest self-care measures. These may include:A supportive splint at either the wrist or elbow to help prevent further injury and relieve the symptoms. You may need to wear it all day and night, or only at night.An elbow pad if the ulnar nerve is injured at the elbow. Also, avoid bumping or leaning on the elbow.Physical therapy exercises to help maintain muscle strength in the arm.Occupational therapy or counseling to suggest changes in the workplace may be needed.Surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve may help if the symptoms get worse, or if there is proof that part of the nerve is wasting away.Outlook (Prognosis)

If the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be found and successfully treated, there is a good chance of a full recovery. In some cases, there may be partial or complete loss of movement or sensation.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Deformity of the handPartial or complete loss of sensation in the hand or fingersPartial or complete loss of wrist or hand movementRecurrent or unnoticed injury to the handWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have an arm injury and develop numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness down your forearm and the ring and little fingers.Prevention

Avoid prolonged pressure on the elbow or palm. Avoid prolonged or repeated elbow bending. Casts, splints, and other appliances should always be examined for proper fit.Alternative Names

 Oral herpes is an infection of the lips, mouth, or gums due to the herpes simplex virus. It causes small, painful blisters commonly called cold sores or fever blisters. Oral herpes is also called herpes labialis.Causes

Oral herpes is a common infection of the mouth area. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Most people in the United States are infected with this virus by age 20.After the first infection, the virus becomes dormant (an inactive state) in the nerve tissues in the face. Sometimes, the virus later reactivates, causing cold sores.Herpes virus type 2 (HSV-2) most often causes genital herpes. However, sometimes HSV-2 is spread to the mouth during oral sex, causing oral herpes. Herpes viruses spread most easily from individuals with an active outbreak or sore. You can catch this virus if you:Have intimate or personal contact with someone who is infectedTouch an open herpes sore or something that has been in contact with the herpes virus, such as infected razors, towels, dishes, and other shared itemsParents may spread the virus to their children during regular daily activities. Symptoms

Some people get mouth ulcers when they first come into contact with HSV-1 virus. Others have no symptoms. Symptoms most often occur in kids between 1 and 5 years old. Symptoms may be mild or severe. They most often appear within 1 to 3 weeks after you come into contact with the virus. They may last up to 3 weeks. Warning symptoms include:Itching of the lips or skin around the mouthBurning near the lips or mouth areaTingling near the lips or mouth area Before blisters appear, you may have:Sore throatFeverSwollen glands in the face or neckPainful swallowing Blisters or a rash may form on your:GumsLipsMouthThroat When many blisters are present, it is called an outbreak.

Exams and Tests

Your health care provider can diagnose oral herpes by looking at your mouth area. Sometimes, a sample of the sore is taken and sent to a laboratory for closer examination. Tests may include:Viral cultureViral DNA testTzanck test to check for HSV Treatment

Symptoms will go away on their own without treatment in 1 to 2 weeks. Your provider can prescribe medicines to fight the virus. This is called antiviral medicine. It can help reduce pain and make your symptoms go away sooner. Medicines used to treat mouth sores include: AcyclovirFamciclovirValacyclovir These medicines work best if you take them when you have warning signs of a mouth sore, before any blisters develop. If you get mouth sores frequently, you may need to take these medicines all the time. Antiviral skin creams may also be used. However, they are expensive and often only shorten the outbreak by a few hours to a day. The following steps can also help make you feel better: Apply ice in a washcloth or a warm washcloth to the sores to help ease pain.Wash the blisters gently with germ-fighting (antiseptic) soap and water. This helps prevent spreading the virus to other body areas.Avoid hot beverages, spicy and salty foods, and citrus.Gargle with cool water or eat fruit-flavored ice pops.Rinse with salt water.Take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).

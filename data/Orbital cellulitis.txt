 Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the fat and muscles around the eye. It affects the eyelids, eyebrows, and cheeks. It may begin suddenly or be a result of an infection that gradually becomes worse.Causes

Orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems. Orbital cellulitis is different than periorbital cellulitis, which is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye.In children, it often starts out as a sinus infection from bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza. The infection used to be more common in young children, under the age of 7. It is now rare due to a vaccine that helps prevent this infection.The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci may also cause orbital cellulitis.Orbital cellulitis infections in children may get worse very quickly and can lead to visual difficulties or blindness. Medical care is needed right away.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Painful swelling of upper and lower eyelid, and possibly the eyebrow and cheekBulging eyesDecreased visionPain when moving the eyeFever, often 102°F (38.8°C) or higherGeneral ill feelingDifficulty with eye movementsDouble visionShiny, red or purple eyelid Exams and Tests

Tests commonly done include:CBC (complete blood count)Blood cultureSpinal tap in affected children who are very sickOther tests may include: X-ray of the sinuses and surrounding areaCT scan or MRI of the sinuses and orbitCulture of eye and nose drainageThroat cultureTreatment

In most cases, a hospital stay is needed. Treatment most often includes antibiotics given through a vein. Surgery may be needed to drain the abscess or relieve pressure in the space around the eye.An orbital cellulitis infection can get worse very quickly. A person with this condition must be checked every few hours. Outlook (Prognosis)

With prompt treatment, the person can recover fully.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Cavernous sinus thrombosis (formation of a blood clot in a cavity at the base of the brain)Hearing lossSepticemia or blood infectionMeningitisOptic nerve damage and loss of visionWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. Contact your health care provider if there are signs of eyelid swelling, especially with a fever.Prevention

Getting scheduled HiB vaccine shots will prevent the infection in most children. Young children who share a household with a person who has this infection may need to take antibiotics to avoid getting sick. Prompt treatment of a sinus or dental infection may prevent it from spreading and becoming orbital cellulitis. Images

 Toxic megacolon occurs when swelling and inflammation spread into the deeper layers of your colon. As a result, the colon stops working and widens. In severe cases, the colon may rupture.Causes

The term "toxic" means that this problem is very dangerous. Toxic megacolon may occur in people with an inflamed colon due to: Ulcerative colitis, or Crohn disease that is not well controlled Infections of the colon such as Clostridioides difficileIschemic bowel diseaseOther forms of megacolon include pseudo-obstruction, acute colonic ileus, or congenital colonic dilation. These conditions do not involve an infected or inflamed colon.Symptoms

The rapid widening of the colon may cause the following symptoms to occur over a short period of time:Painful, distended abdomenFever (sepsis)Diarrhea (usually bloody)Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Findings may include:Tenderness in the abdomenReduced or absent bowel soundsThe exam may reveal signs of septic shock, such as:Increased heart rateMental status changesRapid heart rateLow blood pressureThe provider may order any of the following tests:Abdominal x-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI scan Blood electrolytesComplete blood countTreatment

Treatment of the disorder that led to toxic megacolon includes:Steroids and other medicines that suppress the immune systemAntibioticsIf you have septic shock, you will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital. Treatment may include:Breathing machine (mechanical ventilation)Dialysis for kidney failureDrugs to treat low blood pressure, infection, or poor blood clottingFluids given directly into a veinOxygenIf rapid widening is not treated, an opening or rupture can form in the colon. If the condition doesn't improve with medical treatment, surgery will be needed to remove part or all of the colon.You may receive antibiotics to prevent sepsis (a severe infection).Outlook (Prognosis)

If the condition does not improve, it can be fatal. Colon surgery is usually needed in such cases.Possible Complications

 Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare condition passed down through families. XP causes the skin and tissue covering the eye to be extremely sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. Some people also develop nervous system problems.Causes

XP is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. This means you must have 2 copies of an abnormal gene in order for the disease or trait to develop. The disorder is inherited from both your mother and father at the same time. The abnormal gene is rare, so the chances of both parents having the gene are very rare. For this reason, it is unlikely for somebody with the condition to pass it on to the next generation, although it is possible.UV light, such as from sunlight, damages the genetic material (DNA) in skin cells. Normally, the body repairs this damage. But in people with XP, the body does not fix the damage. As a result, the skin gets very thin and patches of varying color (splotchy pigmentation) appear.Symptoms

Symptoms usually appear by the time a child is 2 years old.Skin symptoms include:Sunburn that does not heal after just a little bit of sun exposureBlistering after just a little bit of sun exposureSpider-like blood vessels under the skinPatches of discolored skin that get worse, resembling severe agingCrusting of the skinScaling of the skinOozing raw skin surfaceDiscomfort when being in bright light (photophobia)Skin cancer at a very young age (including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) Eye symptoms include:Dry eyeClouding of the corneaUlcers of the corneaSwelling or inflammation of the eyelidsCancer of eyelids, cornea or scleraNervous system (neurologic) symptoms, which develop in some children, include:Intellectual disabilityDelayed growthLoss of hearingMuscle weakness of the legs and arms Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam, paying special attention to the skin and eyes. The provider will also ask about a family history of XP.Tests that may be done include:Skin biopsy in which skin cells are studied in the laboratoryDNA testing for the problem gene The following tests can help diagnose the condition in a baby before birth:AmniocentesisChorionic villus samplingCulture of amniotic cells Treatment

People with XP need total protection from sunlight. Even the light coming through windows or from fluorescent bulbs can be dangerous.When out in the sun, protective clothing must be worn.To protect the skin and eyes from the sunlight:Use sunscreen with the highest SPF you can find.Wear long-sleeve shirts and long pants.Wear sunglasses that block UVA and UVB rays. Teach your child to always wear sunglasses when outdoors. To prevent skin cancer, your provider may prescribe medicines, such as a retinoid cream, to apply to the skin.If skin cancer develops, surgery or other methods will be done to remove the cancer.Support Groups

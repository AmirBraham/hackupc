 Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but they are often felt in your fingers, hands, feet, arms, or legs.Causes

There are many possible causes of numbness and tingling, including:Sitting or standing in the same position for a long timeInjuring a nerve (a neck injury may cause you to feel numbness anywhere along your arm or hand, while a low back injury can cause numbness or tingling along your leg or foot)Pressure on the nerves of the spine, such as from a herniated diskPressure on peripheral nerves from enlarged blood vessels, tumors, scar tissue, or infection or due to compression of a body part (such as sitting with legs crossed)Shingles or herpes zoster infectionOther infections such as HIV/AIDS, leprosy, syphilis, or tuberculosisLack of blood supply to an area, such as from hardening of the arteries, frostbite, or vessel inflammationAbnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your bodyDeficiency of B vitamins such as B1, B6, B12, or folic acidUse of certain medicinesUse of certain illicit street drugsNerve damage due to lead, alcohol, or tobacco, or from chemotherapy medicinesRadiation therapyAnimal bitesInsect, tick, mite, and spider bitesSeafood toxins Congenital conditions that affect the nervesAutoimmune diseases that attack the nervesNumbness and tingling can be caused by other medical conditions, including:Carpal tunnel syndrome (pressure on the median nerve at the wrist)DiabetesMigrainesMultiple sclerosisSeizuresStrokeTransient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a "mini-stroke"Underactive thyroidRaynaud phenomenon (narrowing of the blood vessels, usually in the hands and feet)Home Care

Your health care provider should find and treat the cause of your numbness or tingling. Treating the condition may make the symptoms go away or stop them from getting worse. For example, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or low back pain, your provider may recommend certain exercises or other treatments.If you have diabetes, your provider will discuss ways to control your blood sugar level.Low levels of vitamins will be treated with vitamin supplements.Medicines that cause numbness or tingling may need to be switched or changed. Do not change or stop taking any of your medicines or take large doses of any vitamins or supplements until you have talked with your provider.Because numbness can cause a decrease in feeling, you may be more likely to accidentally injure a numb hand or foot. Take care to protect the area from cuts, bumps, bruises, burns, or other injuries. If you have chronic numbness of the feet (such as from diabetes), seeing a podiatrist regularly can help prevent complications.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to a hospital or call 911 or the local emergency number if:You have weakness or are unable to move, along with numbness or tinglingNumbness or tingling occur just after a head, neck, or back injuryYou cannot control the movement of an arm or a leg, or you have lost bladder or bowel controlYou are confused or have lost consciousness, even brieflyYou have slurred speech, a change in vision, difficulty walking, or weakness Contact your provider if:Numbness or tingling has no obvious cause (like a hand or foot "falling asleep")You have pain in your neck, forearm, or fingersYou are urinating more oftenNumbness or tingling is in your legs and gets worse when you walkYou have a rashYou have dizziness, muscle spasm, or other unusual symptoms What to Expect at Your Office Visit

Your provider will take a medical history and perform a physical examination, carefully checking your nervous system.You will be asked about your symptoms. Questions may include when the problem began, its location, or if there's anything that improves or worsens the symptoms.Your provider may also ask questions to determine your risk for stroke, thyroid disease, or diabetes, as well as questions about your work habits and medicines.Blood tests that may be ordered include:Complete blood count (CBC)Screening for diabetes with glucose testsElectrolyte level (measurement of body chemicals and minerals) and liver function testsThyroid function testsMeasurement of vitamin levels, particularly vitamin B12Heavy metal or toxicology screeningSedimentation rateC-reactive proteinImaging tests may include:Angiogram (a test that uses x-rays and a special dye to see inside the blood vessels)CT angiogram of the head and neckCT scan of the headCT scan of the spineMRI of the headMRI of the spineUltrasound of neck vessels to determine your risk for TIA or strokeVascular ultrasoundX-ray of the affected areaOther tests that may be done include:Electromyography and nerve conduction studies to measure how your muscles respond to nerve stimulationLumbar puncture (spinal tap) to rule out central nervous system disordersCold stimulation test may be done to check for Raynaud phenomenonGenetic testing for nerve problems that run in families.Alternative Names

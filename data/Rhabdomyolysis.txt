 Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood. These substances are harmful to the kidney and often cause kidney damage.Causes

When muscle is damaged, a protein called myoglobin is released into the bloodstream. It is then filtered out of the body by the kidneys. Myoglobin breaks down into substances that can damage kidney cells.Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by injury or any other condition that damages skeletal muscle.Problems that may lead to this disease include:Trauma or crush injuriesUse of drugs or medicines such as cocaine, amphetamines, statins, heroin, or PCPGenetic muscle diseasesExtremes of body temperatureIschemia or death of muscle tissueLow phosphate levelsSeizures or muscle tremorsSevere exertion, such as marathon running or calisthenicsLengthy surgical proceduresSevere dehydration Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Dark, red, or cola-colored urineDecreased urine outputGeneral weaknessMuscle stiffness or aching (myalgia)Muscle tendernessWeakness of the affected muscles Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:FatigueJoint painSeizuresWeight gain (unintentional)Exams and Tests

A physical exam will show tender or damaged skeletal muscles.The following tests may be done:Creatine kinase (CK) levelSerum calciumSerum myoglobinSerum potassiumUrinalysisUrine myoglobin test This disease may also affect the results of the following tests:CK isoenzymesSerum creatinineUrine creatinineTreatment

You will need to get fluids containing bicarbonate to help prevent kidney damage. You may need to get fluids through a vein (IV). Some people may need kidney dialysis.Your health care provider may prescribe medicines including diuretics and bicarbonate (if there is enough urine output).Hyperkalemia and low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) should be treated right away. Kidney failure should also be treated.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome depends on the amount of kidney damage. Acute kidney failure occurs in many people. Getting treated soon after rhabdomyolysis will reduce the risk of permanent kidney damage.People with milder cases may return to their normal activities within a few weeks to a month. However, some people continue to have problems with fatigue and muscle pain.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Acute tubular necrosisAcute renal failureHarmful chemical imbalances in the bloodShock (low blood pressure) When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of rhabdomyolysis.Prevention

Rhabdomyolysis can be avoided by:Avoiding drugs or medicines that may cause rhabdomyolysis.Drinking plenty of fluids after strenuous exercise.Removing extra clothes and immersing the body in cold water in case of heat stroke.Images

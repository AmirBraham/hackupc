 Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a rare but very severe type of bacterial infection. It can destroy the muscles, skin, and underlying tissue. The word "necrotizing" refers to something that causes body tissue to die.Causes

Many different types of bacteria can cause this infection. A very severe and usually deadly form of necrotizing soft tissue infection is due to the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, which is sometimes called "flesh-eating bacteria" or strep.Necrotizing soft tissue infection develops when the bacteria enters the body, usually through a minor cut or scrape. The bacteria begin to grow and release harmful substances (toxins) that kill tissue and affect blood flow to the area. With flesh-eating strep, the bacteria also make chemicals that block the body's ability to respond to the organism. As the tissue dies, the bacteria enters the blood and rapidly spreads throughout the body.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:A small, red, painful lump or bump on the skin that spreadsA very painful bruise-like area then develops and grows rapidly, sometimes in less than an hourThe center becomes dark and dusky and then turns black and the tissue diesThe skin may break open and ooze fluid Other symptoms may include:Feeling illFeverSweatingChillsNauseaDizzinessWeaknessShock Exams and Tests

Your health care provider may be able to diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Or, the condition may be diagnosed in an operating room by a surgeon.Tests that may be done include:UltrasoundX-ray or CT scanBlood testsBlood culture to check for bacteriaAn incision of the skin to see if pus is presentSkin tissue biopsy and cultureTreatment

Treatment is needed right away to prevent death. You'll likely need to stay in the hospital. Treatment includes:Powerful antibiotics given through a vein (IV)Surgery to drain the sore and remove dead tissueSpecial medicines called donor immunoglobulins (antibodies) to help fight the infection in some casesOther treatments may include:Skin grafts after the infection goes away to help your skin heal and look betterAmputation if the disease spreads through an arm or legHundred percent oxygen at high pressure (hyperbaric oxygen therapy) for certain types of bacterial infectionsOutlook (Prognosis)

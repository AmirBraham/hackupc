 Malignant hypertension is very high blood pressure that comes on suddenly and quickly.Causes

The disorder affects a small number of people with high blood pressure, including children and adults. It is more common in younger adults, especially African American men.It also occurs in people with:Collagen vascular disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and periarteritis nodosa)Kidney problemsPregnancy-induced high blood pressure (toxemia of pregnancy also called preeclampsia) You are at high risk for malignant hypertension if you smoke and if you have had:Kidney failureRenal hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis Symptoms

Symptoms of malignant hypertension include:Blurred visionChange in mental status, such as anxiety, confusion, decreased alertness, decreased ability to concentrate, fatigue, restlessness, sleepiness, or stuporChest pain (feeling of crushing or pressure)CoughHeadacheNausea or vomitingNumbness of the arms, legs, face, or other areasReduced urine outputSeizureShortness of breathWeakness of the arms, legs, face, or other areas Exams and Tests

Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency.A physical exam commonly shows:Extremely high blood pressureSwelling in the lower legs and feetAbnormal heart sounds and fluid in the lungsChanges in thinking, sensation, and reflexes An eye exam may reveal changes that indicate very high blood pressure, including:Bleeding of the retina (back part of the eye)Narrowing of the blood vessels in the retinaSwelling of the optic nerveOther problems with the retinaTests to determine damage to the kidneys may include:Arterial blood gas analysisBUN (blood urea nitrogen)CreatinineUrinalysisKidney ultrasound A chest x-ray may show congestion in the lungs and an enlarged heart.This disease may also affect the results of these tests:Level of aldosterone (a hormone from the adrenal gland)Cardiac enzymes (markers of heart damage)CT scan of the brainElectrocardiogram (ECG)Renin levelUrinary sediment Treatment

You will need to stay in the hospital until your severe high blood pressure is under control. You will receive medicines through a vein (IV) to reduce your blood pressure.If there is fluid in your lungs, you will be given medicines called diuretics, which help the body remove fluid. Your doctor may give you medicines to protect your heart if you have signs of heart damage.After your severe high blood pressure is under control, blood pressure medicines taken by mouth can control blood pressure. Your medicine may need to be changed sometimes. High blood pressure can be difficult to control.Outlook (Prognosis)

Many body systems are at serious risk from the extreme rise in blood pressure. Organs including the brain, eyes, blood vessels, heart, and kidneys may be damaged.The blood vessels of the kidney are very likely to be damaged by high blood pressure. Kidney failure may develop, which may be permanent. If this happens, you may need dialysis (machine that removes waste products from blood).If treated right away, malignant hypertension can often be controlled without causing permanent problems. If it is not treated right away, it can be fatal.Possible Complications

These complications may occur:Brain damage (stroke, seizures)Heart damage, including: heart attack, angina (chest pain due to narrowed blood vessels or weakened heart muscle), heart rhythm disturbancesKidney failurePermanent blindnessFluid in the lungsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of malignant hypertension. This is an emergency condition that can be life threatening.Contact your health care provider if you know you have poorly controlled high blood pressure.Prevention

If you have high blood pressure, carefully monitor your blood pressure and take your medicines properly to help reduce your risk. Eat a healthy diet that is low in salt and fat.Alternative Names

 Renal vein thrombosis is a blood clot that develops in the vein that drains blood from the kidney.Causes

Renal vein thrombosis is an uncommon disorder. It may be caused by:Abdominal aortic aneurysmHypercoagulable state: clotting disordersDehydration (mostly in infants)Estrogen useNephrotic syndromePregnancyScar formation with pressure on the renal veinTrauma (to the back or abdomen)TumorIn adults, the most common cause is nephrotic syndrome. In infants, the most common cause is dehydration.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Blood clot to the lungBloody urineDecreased urine outputFlank pain or low back pain Exams and Tests

An exam may not reveal the specific problem. However, it may indicate nephrotic syndrome or other causes of renal vein thrombosis.Tests include:Abdominal CT scanAbdominal MRIAbdominal ultrasoundDuplex Doppler exam of the renal veinsUrinalysis may show protein in the urine or red blood cells in the urineX-ray of the kidney veins (venography) Treatment

The treatment helps to prevent the formation of new clots and reduces the risk of clot traveling to other locations in the body (embolization).You may get medicines that prevent blood clotting (anticoagulants). You may be told to rest in bed or cut down on activity for a short time. If sudden kidney failure develops, you may need dialysis for a short period.Outlook (Prognosis)

Renal vein thrombosis most often gets better over time without lasting damage to the kidneys.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Acute renal failure (especially if thrombosis occurs in a dehydrated child)End stage renal diseaseBlood clot moves to the lungs (pulmonary embolism)Formation of new blood clots When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of renal vein thrombosis.If you have experienced renal vein thrombosis, call your provider if you have:Decrease in urine outputBlood in the urineBreathing problems (due to blood clot moving to your lung called pulmonary embolism)Other new symptoms Prevention

In most cases, there is no specific way to prevent renal vein thrombosis. Keeping enough fluids in the body may help reduce risk.Aspirin is sometimes used to prevent renal vein thrombosis in people who have had a kidney transplant. Blood thinners such as warfarin may be recommendedÂ for some people with chronic kidney disease.Alternative Names

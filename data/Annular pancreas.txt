 An annular pancreas is a ring of pancreatic tissue that encircles the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The normal position of the pancreas is next to, but not surrounding the duodenum.Causes

Annular pancreas is problem present at birth (congenital defect). Symptoms occur when the ring of pancreas squeezes and narrows the small intestine so that food cannot pass easily or at all.Newborns may have symptoms of complete blockage of the intestine. However, up to one half of people with this condition do not have symptoms until adulthood. There are also cases that are not detected because the symptoms are mild.Conditions that may be associated with annular pancreas include:Down syndromeExcess amniotic fluid during pregnancy (polyhydramnios)Other congenital gastrointestinal problemsPancreatitis Symptoms

Newborns may not feed well. They may spit up more than normal, not drink enough breast milk or formula, and cry.Adult symptoms may include:Fullness after eatingNausea or vomitingExams and Tests

Tests include:Abdominal ultrasoundAbdominal x-rayCT scanUpper GI and small bowel seriesTreatment

Treatment most often involves surgery to bypass the blocked part of the duodenum.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome is most often good with surgery. Adults with an annular pancreas are at increased risk for pancreatic or biliary tract cancer.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Obstructive jaundicePancreatic cancerPancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)Peptic ulcerPerforation (tearing a hole) of the intestine due to obstructionPeritonitisWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

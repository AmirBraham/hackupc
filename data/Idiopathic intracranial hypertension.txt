 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition in which the pressure inside the skull is increased. The brain is affected in a way that the condition appears to be, but is not, a tumor.Causes

The condition occurs more often in women than men, especially in young obese women 20 to 40 years old. It is rare in infants, but can occur in children. Before puberty, it occurs equally in boys and girls.The cause is unknown.Certain medicines can increase the risk of developing this condition. These medicines include:AmiodaroneBirth control pills such as levonorgestrel (Norplant)CyclosporineCytarabineGrowth hormoneIsotretinoinLevothyroxine (children)Lithium carbonateMinocyclineNalidixic acidNitrofurantoinPhenytoinSteroids (starting or stopping them)Sulfa antibioticsTamoxifenTetracyclineCertain drugs that contain Vitamin A, such as cis-retinoic acid (Accutane)The following factors are also related to this condition:Down syndromeBehcet diseaseChronic kidney failureEndocrine (hormone) disorders such as Addison disease, Cushing disease, hypoparathyroidism, polycystic ovary syndromeFollowing treatment (embolization) of an arteriovenous malformationInfectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Lyme disease, following chickenpox in childrenIron deficiency anemiaObesityObstructive sleep apneaPregnancy Sarcoidosis (inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues)Systemic lupus erythematosisTurner syndromeSymptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Headaches, throbbing, daily, irregular and worse in the morningNeck painBlurred visionBuzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus)DizzinessDouble vision (diplopia)Nausea, vomitingVision problems such as flashing or even loss of visionLow back pain, radiating along both legsHeadaches may get worse during physical activity, especially when you tighten the stomach muscles during coughing or straining.Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Signs of this condition include:Bulging anterior fontanelle in infantsIncreased head size in infantsSwelling of the optic nerve in the back of the eye (papilledema)Inward turning of the eye toward the nose (sixth cranial, or abducens, nerve palsy)Even though there is increased pressure in the skull, there is no change in alertness.Tests that may be done include:Funduscopic examinationCT scan of the headEye exam, including visual field testingMRI of the head with MR venographyLumbar puncture (spinal tap) Diagnosis is made when other health conditions are ruled out. These include conditions that may cause increased pressure in the skull, such as:HydrocephalusTumorVenous sinus thrombosis InfectionTreatment

Treatment is aimed at the cause of IIH. The main goal of treatments is to preserve vision and reduce the severity of headaches.A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) can help relieve pressure in the brain and prevent vision problems. Repeat lumbar punctures are helpful for pregnant women in order to delay surgery until after delivery.Other treatments may include:Fluid or salt restrictionMedicines such as corticosteroids, acetazolamide, furosemide, and topiramateShunting procedures to relieve pressure from spinal fluid buildupSurgery to relieve pressure on the optic nerveWeight loss Treatment of the underlying disease, such as vitamin A overdosePeople will need to have their vision closely monitored. There can be vision loss, which is sometimes permanent. Follow-up MRI or CT scans may be done to rule out problems such as tumors or hydrocephalus (buildup of fluid inside the skull).In some cases, the pressure inside the brain remains high for many years. Symptoms can return in some people. A small number of people have symptoms that slowly get worse and lead to blindness.Outlook (Prognosis)

The condition sometimes disappears on its own within 6 months. Symptoms can return in some people. A small number of people have symptoms that slowly get worse and lead to blindness.Possible Complications

Vision loss is a serious complication of this condition.When to Contact a Medical Professional

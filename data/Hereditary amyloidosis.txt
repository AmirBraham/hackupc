 Hereditary amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal protein deposits (called amyloid) form in almost every tissue in the body. Harmful deposits most often form in the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. These protein deposits damage the tissues and interfere with how organs work.Causes

Hereditary amyloidosis is passed down from parents to their children (inherited). Genes may also play a role in primary amyloidosis. Other types of amyloidosis are not inherited. They include:Senile systemic: seen in people older than 70Spontaneous: occurs without a known causeSecondary: results from diseases such as cancer of certain blood cells (myeloma)Specific conditions include:Cardiac amyloidosisCerebral amyloidosisSecondary systemic amyloidosisTreatment

Treatment to improve the function of damaged organs will help relieve some symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis. A liver transplant may be helpful to reduce the creation of harmful amyloid proteins. Talk to your health care provider about treatments.Alternative Names

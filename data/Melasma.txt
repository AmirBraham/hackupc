 Melasma is a skin condition that causes patches of dark skin on areas of the face exposed to the sun.Causes

Melasma is a common skin disorder. It most often appears in young women with brownish skin tone, but it can affect anyone.Melasma is often associated with the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. It is common in:Pregnant womenWomen taking birth control pills (oral contraceptives)Women who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause. Being in the sun makes melasma more likely to develop. The problem is more common in tropical climates.Symptoms

The only symptom of melasma is a change in skin color. However, this color change can cause distress about your appearance.The skin color changes are most often an even brown color. They often appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. Dark patches are often symmetrical.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will look at your skin to diagnose the problem. A closer exam using a device called a Wood's lamp (which uses ultraviolet light) may help guide your treatment.Treatment

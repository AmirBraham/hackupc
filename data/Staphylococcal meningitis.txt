 Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.Bacteria are one type of germ that may cause meningitis. The staphylococcal bacteria are one type of bacteria that cause meningitis.Causes

Staphylococcal meningitis is caused by staphylococcus bacteria. When it is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria, it usually develops as a complication of surgery or as an infection that spreads through the blood from another site.Risk factors include:Infections of heart valvesPast infection of the brainPast meningitis due to spinal fluid shuntsRecent brain surgeryThe presence of a spinal fluid shuntTrauma Bloodstream infection with Staphylococcus aureusSymptoms

Symptoms may come on quickly, and include:
   Fever and chillsMental status changesNausea and vomitingSensitivity to light (photophobia)Severe headacheStiff neck Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:AgitationBulging fontanelles in infantsDecreased alertnessPoor feeding or irritability in childrenRapid breathingUnusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards (opisthotonos) Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Questions will focus on symptoms and risk factors.If the doctor thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is done to remove a sample of spinal fluid for testing. If you have a spinal fluid shunt, the sample may be taken from this instead. Tests may include:Blood cultureChest x-rayCT scan of the headGram stain or other special stains, and culture of the spinal fluidTreatment

Antibiotics will be started as soon as possible. Vancomycin is the first choice for suspected staphylococcal meningitis. Nafcillin is used when tests show that the bacteria are sensitive to this antibiotic.Often, treatment will include a search for, and removal of, possible sources of bacteria in the body. These include shunts or artificial heart valves.Outlook (Prognosis)

Early treatment improves the outcome. However, some people do not survive. Young children and adults over age 50 have the highest risk for death.Staphylococcal meningitis often improves more quickly, with fewer complications, if the source of the infection is removed. The source may include shunts, hardware in joints, or artificial heart valves.Possible Complications

Long-term complications may include:Brain damageBuildup of fluid between the skull and brain (subdural effusion)Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) Hearing lossSeizures 
 Staph infection in another area of the bodyWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:
   Feeding problems
   
   High-pitched cry
   
   Irritability
   
   Persistent, unexplained fever
   Meningitis can quickly become a life-threatening illness.Prevention

In high-risk people, taking antibiotics before diagnostic or surgical procedures may help reduce the risk. Discuss this with your doctor.Images

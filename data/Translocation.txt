 Translocation means a change in location. It often refers to genetics, when part of a chromosome is transferred to another chromosome. Chromosomes are structures that carry genes, our units of heredity. When a translocation occurs, it can cause flaws in chromosomes. In another type of translocation, two chromosomes trade pieces with each other.Genetic translocations can cause serious disorders, including a type of leukemia.Images

Specific types of funnel-web spiders are found in southeast Australia, around Sydney. Others are found in Europe, New Zealand, and Chile. They are not native to the United States, although some people may keep them as exotic pets. The webs that are built by this group of spiders consist of funnel-shaped tubes that extend into a protected space such as a hole in a tree or a burrow in the ground.Symptoms

The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The wound will be treated as appropriate.The person may receive:Antivenin, a medicine to reverse the effects of the venom, if availableBlood and urine testsBreathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine (ventilator)Chest x-rayECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein)Medicines to treat symptoms Outlook (Prognosis)

Funnel-web spider bites can be life threatening, especially in children. They must be treated quickly with antivenin by an experienced provider. Even with appropriate and quick treatment, symptoms may last for several days to weeks. The original bite may be small and may progress to a blood blister and look like a bull's eye. (This is similar to the appearance of a brown recluse spider bite.)The area affected by the bite may become deeper. Additional symptoms such as fever, chills, and other signs of additional organ system involvement may develop. Deep scarring may occur and surgery may be needed to improve appearance of the scar.Images

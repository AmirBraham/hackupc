 A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection of the urinary tract. The infection can occur at different points in the urinary tract, including the: 
   Bladder -- An infection in the bladder is also called cystitis or a bladder infection.
   Kidneys -- An infection of one or both kidneys is called pyelonephritis or a kidney infection.
   Ureters -- The tubes that take urine from each kidney to the bladder are rarely the only site of infection.
   Urethra -- An infection of the tube that empties urine from the bladder to the outside is called urethritis. Causes

Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. The infection most commonly develops in the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk for having UTIs.Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk for a UTI.The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI:DiabetesAdvanced ageConditions that affect personal care habits (such as Alzheimer disease and delirium)Problems emptying the bladder completelyHaving a urinary catheterBowel incontinenceEnlarged prostate, narrowed urethra, or anything that blocks the flow of urineKidney stonesStaying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture)PregnancySurgery or other procedure involving the urinary tract Symptoms

The symptoms of a bladder infection include:Cloudy or bloody urine, which may have a foul or strong odorLow grade fever in some peoplePain or burning with urinationPressure or cramping in the lower abdomen or backStrong need to urinate often, even right after the bladder has been emptied If the infection spreads to your kidneys, symptoms may include:Chills and shaking or night sweatsFatigue and a general ill feelingFever above 101°F (38.3°C)Pain in the side, back, or groinFlushed, warm, or reddened skinMental changes or confusion (in older people, these symptoms often are the only signs of a UTI)Nausea and vomitingSevere abdominal pain (sometimes) Exams and Tests

Most of the time, you will need to provide a urine sample for the following tests: Urinalysis -- This test is done to look for white blood cells, red blood cells, bacteria, and to test chemicals such as nitrites in the urine. This test can diagnose an infection most of the time.Clean-catch urine culture -- This test may be done to identify the bacteria and determine the best antibiotic for treatment. Blood tests such as complete blood count (CBC) and a blood culture may be done as well.You may also need the following tests to help check for other problems in your urinary system:CT scan of the abdomenIntravenous pyelogram (IVP)Kidney ultrasoundVoiding cystourethrogramTreatment

Your health care provider must first decide if the infection is just in the bladder, or if it has spread to the kidneys and how severe it is. MILD BLADDER AND KIDNEY INFECTIONSMost of the time, you will need to take an antibiotic to prevent the infection from spreading to the kidneys.For a simple bladder infection, you will take antibiotics for 3 days (women) or 7 to 14 days (men).If you are pregnant or have diabetes, or have a mild kidney infection, you will most often take antibiotics for 7 to 14 days.Finish all of the antibiotics, even if you feel better. If you do not finish the whole dose of medicine, the infection may return and be harder to treat later.Always drink plenty of water when you have a bladder or kidney infection.Tell your provider if you might be pregnant before taking these drugs. RECURRENT BLADDER INFECTIONSSome women have repeated bladder infections. Your provider may suggest that you:Take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual contact to prevent an infection.Have a 3-day course of antibiotics at home to use if you develop an infection.Take a single, daily dose of an antibiotic to prevent infections. MORE SEVERE KIDNEY INFECTIONSYou may need to go into the hospital if you are very sick and cannot take medicines by mouth or drink enough fluids. You may also be admitted to the hospital if you:Are an older adultHave kidney stones or changes in the anatomy of your urinary tractHave recently had urinary tract surgeryHave cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or other medical problemsAre pregnant and have a fever or are otherwise ill At the hospital, you will receive fluids and antibiotics through a vein.Some people have UTIs that do not go away with treatment or keep coming back. These are called chronic UTIs. If you have a chronic UTI, you may need stronger antibiotics or to take medicine for a longer time. You may need surgery if the infection is caused by a problem with the structure of the urinary tract.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most UTIs can be cured. Bladder infection symptoms most often go away within 24 to 48 hours after treatment begins. If you have a kidney infection, it may take 1 week or longer for symptoms to go away.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Life-threatening blood infection (sepsis) -- The risk is greater among the young, very old adults, and people whose bodies cannot fight infections (for example, due to HIV or cancer chemotherapy).Kidney damage or scarring.Kidney infection.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Contact your provider right away if you have signs of a possible kidney infection, such as:Back or side painChillsFeverVomiting Also contact your provider if UTI symptoms come back shortly after you have been treated with antibiotics. Prevention

Diet and lifestyle changes may help prevent some UTIs. After menopause, a woman may use estrogen cream around the vagina to reduce infections.Alternative Names

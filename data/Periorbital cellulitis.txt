 Periorbital cellulitis is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye.Causes

Periorbital cellulitis can occur at any age, but more commonly affects children younger than 5 years old.This infection can occur after a scratch, injury, or bug bite around the eye, which allows germs to enter the wound. It can also extend from a nearby site that is infected, such as the sinuses.Periorbital cellulitis is different than orbital cellulitis, which is an infection of the fat and muscles around the eye. In contrast to periorbital cellulitis, orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems and deeper infections.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Redness around the eye or in the white part of the eyeSwelling of the eyelid, whites of eyes, and surrounding area This condition does not often affect vision or cause eye pain.Exams and Tests

Antibiotics are given by mouth, by shots, or through a vein (intravenously; IV) to help fight the infection.Outlook (Prognosis)

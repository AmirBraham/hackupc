 Aminoaciduria is an abnormally high amount of amino acids in the urine. Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins in the body.How the Test is Performed

A clean-catch urine sampleÂ may be needed. This is often done at your health care provider's office or health clinic.How to Prepare for the Test

Most of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test. Make sure your provider knows all of the medicines you recently used. If this test is being done on an infant who is breastfeeding, make sure the provider knows what medicines the nursing mother is taking.How the Test will Feel

The test involves only normal urination.Why the Test is Performed

This test is done to measure amino acid levels in the urine. There are many different types of amino acids. It is common for some of each kind to be found in the urine. Increased levels of individual amino acids can be a sign of a problem with metabolism.Normal Results

The specific value is measured in mmol/mol creatinine. The values below represent normal ranges in 24 hours urine for adults.Alanine: 9 to 98Arginine: 0 to 8Asparagine: 10 to 65Aspartic acid: 5 to 50Citrulline: 1 to 22Cystine: 2 to 12Glutamic acid: 0 to 21Glutamine: 11 to 42Glycine: 17 to 146Histidine: 49 to 413Isoleucine: 30 to 186Leucine: 1 to 9Lysine: 2 to 16Methionine: 2 to 53Ornithine: 1 to 5Phenylalanine: 1 to 5Proline: 3 to 13Serine: 0 to 9Taurine: 18 to 89Threonine: 13 to 587Tyrosine: 3 to 14Valine: 3 to 36Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.What Abnormal Results Mean

Increased total urine amino acids may be due to:AlkaptonuriaCanavan diseaseCystinosisCystathioninuriaFructose intoleranceGalactosemiaHartnup diseaseHomocystinuriaHyperammonemiaHyperparathyroidismMaple syrup urine diseaseMethylmalonic acidemiaMultiple myelomaOrnithine transcarbamylase deficiencyOsteomalaciaPropionic acidemiaRicketsTyrosinemia type 1Tyrosinemia type 2Viral hepatitisWilson diseaseConsiderations

Screening infants for increased levels of amino acids can help detect problems with metabolism. Early treatment for these conditions may prevent complications in the future.Alternative Names

 Loss of brain function occurs when the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood. This is called hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This problem may occur suddenly or it may develop slowly over time.Causes

An important function of the liver is to make toxic substances in the body harmless. These substances may be made by the body (ammonia), or substances that you take in (medicines).When the liver is damaged, these "poisons" can build up in the bloodstream and affect the function of the nervous system. The result may be HE.HE can occur suddenly and you may become ill very quickly. Causes of HE may include:Hepatitis A or B infection (uncommon to occur this way)Blockage of blood supply to the liverPoisoning by different toxins or medicinesConstipationUpper gastrointestinal bleedingPeople with severe liver damage often suffer from HE. The end result of chronic liver damage is cirrhosis. Common causes of chronic liver disease are:Severe hepatitis B or C infectionAlcohol abuseAutoimmune hepatitisBile duct disordersSome medicinesNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)Once you have liver damage, episodes of worsening brain function may be triggered by:Loss of body fluids (dehydration)Eating too much proteinLow blood potassium or sodium levelsBleeding in the intestines, stomach, or food pipe (esophagus)InfectionsKidney problemsLow oxygen levels in the bodyShunt placement or complicationsSurgeryNarcotic pain or sedative medicinesDisorders that can appear similar to HE may include:Alcohol intoxicationAlcohol withdrawalBleeding inside the skull (subdural hematoma)Brain disorder caused by lack of vitamin B1 (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome)In some cases, HE is a short-term problem that can be corrected. It may also occur as part of a long-term (chronic) problem from liver disease that gets worse over time.Symptoms

Symptoms of HE are graded on a scale of grades 1 to 4. They may begin slowly and worsen over time.Early symptoms may be mild and include:Breath with a musty or sweet odorChanges in sleep patternsChanges in thinkingMild confusionForgetfulnessPersonality or mood changesPoor concentration and judgmentWorsening of handwriting or loss of other small hand movementsSevere symptoms may include:Abnormal movements or shaking of hands or armsAgitation, excitement, or seizures (occur rarely)DisorientationDrowsiness or confusionBehavior or personality changesSlurred speechSlowed or sluggish movementPeople with HE can become unconscious, unresponsive, and possibly enter into a coma.People are often not able to care for themselves because of these symptoms.Exams and Tests

Signs of nervous system changes may include:Shaking of the hands ("flapping tremor" or asterixis) when trying to hold arms in front of the body and lift the handsProblems with thinking and doing mental tasksSigns of liver disease, such as yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) and fluid collection in the abdomen (ascites)Musty odor to the breath and urineTests done may include:Complete blood count or hematocrit to check for anemiaCT scan of the head or MRIEEGLiver function testsProthrombin timeSerum ammonia level in the blood Sodium level in the bloodPotassium level in the bloodBUN (blood urea nitrogen) and blood creatinine to see how the kidneys are working Treatment

Treatment of HE depends upon the cause.If changes in brain function are severe, a hospital stay may be needed.Bleeding in the digestive tract must be stopped.Infections, kidney failure, and changes in sodium and potassium levels need to be treated. Medicines are given to help lower ammonia level and improve brain function. Medicines given may include:Lactulose to prevent bacteria in the intestines from creating ammonia. It may cause diarrhea.Neomycin and rifaximin also reduce the amount of ammonia made in the intestines.If the HE improves while taking rifaximin, it should be continued indefinitely. You should avoid:Any sedatives, tranquilizers, and any other medicines that are broken down by the liverMedicines containing ammonium (including certain antacids) Your health care provider may suggest other medicines and treatments. These may have varying results.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outlook of HE depends on the management of the cause of HE. Chronic forms of the disorder often continue to get worse and come back.The first two stages of the disease have a good prognosis. Stage three and four have a poor prognosis. When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you or people around you notice any problems with your mental state or nervous system function. This is important for people who already have a liver disorder. HE can get worse quickly and become an emergency condition.Prevention

Treating liver problems may prevent HE. Avoiding alcohol and intravenous drugs can prevent many liver disorders.Alternative Names

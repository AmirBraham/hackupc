 IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder in which antibodies (called IgA) build up in kidney tissue. Nephropathy is damage, disease, or other problems with the kidney.IgA nephropathy is also called Berger disease.Causes

IgA is a protein, called an antibody, that helps the body fight infections. IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein is deposited in the kidneys. IgA builds up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney. Structures in the kidney called glomeruli become inflamed and damaged.The disorder can appear suddenly (acute), or get worse slowly over many years (chronic glomerulonephritis).Risk factors include:A personal or family history of IgA nephropathy or Henoch-Schönlein purpura, a form of vasculitis that affects many parts of the bodyWhite or Asian ethnicityIgA nephropathy can occur in people of all ages, but it most often affects males in their teens to late 30s.Symptoms

There may be no symptoms for many years.When there are symptoms, they may include:Bloody urine that starts during or soon after a respiratory infectionRepeated episodes of dark or bloody urineSwelling of the hands and feetSymptoms of chronic kidney diseaseExams and Tests

IgA nephropathy is most often discovered when a person with no other symptoms of kidney problems has one or more episodes of dark or bloody urine.There are no specific changes seen during a physical examination. Sometimes, the blood pressure may be high or there may be swelling in parts of the body.Tests include:Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test to measure kidney functionCreatinine blood test to measure kidney functionKidney biopsy to confirm the diagnosisUrinalysisTreatment

The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent or delay chronic renal failure.The treatment may include:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to control high blood pressure and swelling (edema)Corticosteroids, other medicines that suppress the immune systemFish oilMedicines to lower cholesterolSalt and fluid intakes may be restricted to control swelling. A low-to-moderate protein diet may be recommended in some cases.Eventually, many people must be treated for chronic kidney disease and may need dialysis.Outlook (Prognosis)

IgA nephropathy gets worse slowly. In many cases, it does not get worse at all. Your condition is more likely to get worse if you have:High blood pressureLarge amounts of protein in the urineIncreased BUN or creatinine levelsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if you have bloody urine or if you are producing less urine than usual.Alternative Names

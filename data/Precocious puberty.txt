 Puberty is the time when a person's sexual and physical characteristics mature. Precocious puberty is when these body changes happen earlier than normal.Causes

Puberty usually begins between ages 8 and 13 for girls and ages 9 and 14 for boys.The exact age a child enters puberty depends on a number of factors, including family history, nutrition, and sex.Most often there is no clear cause for precocious puberty. Some cases are due to changes in the brain, genetic problems or certain tumors that release hormones. These conditions include:Disorders of the testicles, ovaries, or adrenal glandsTumor of the hypothalamus (hypothalamic hamartoma)Tumors that release a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) Symptoms

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam to check for signs of precocious puberty.Tests that may be ordered include:Blood tests to check hormone levels.CT or MRI scan of the brain or of the abdomen to check for tumors. Treatment

Depending on the cause, treatment for precocious puberty may include:Medicines to stop the release of sexual hormones, to help delay puberty. These medicines are given as a shot (injection). They will be given until the normal age of puberty.Surgery to remove a tumor.Children with early sexual development may have psychological and social problems. Children and adolescents want to be the same as their peers. Early sexual development can make them appear different. Parents can support their child by explaining the condition and how their provider plans to treat it. Talking to a mental health worker or counselor may also help.Possible Complications

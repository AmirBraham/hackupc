Avoiding your triggers may help you prevent or reduce flare-ups.Some things you can do to help ease or prevent symptoms include:Avoid sun exposure. Use sunscreen every day.Avoid a lot of activity in hot weather.Try to reduce stress. Try deep breathing, yoga, or other relaxation techniques.Limit spicy foods, alcohol, and hot beverages. Other triggers may include wind, hot baths, cold weather, specific skin products, exercise, or other factors.Antibiotics taken by mouth or applied to the skin may control acne-like skin problems. Ask your provider.Isotretinoin is a strong drug that your provider might consider. It is used in people who have severe rosacea that hasn't improved after treatment with other medicines.Rosacea is not acne and will not improve with over-the-counter acne treatment.In very bad cases, laser surgery may help reduce the redness. Surgery to remove some swollen nose tissue may also improve your appearance.Outlook (Prognosis)

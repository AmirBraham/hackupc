 Watery eyes means you have too many tears in and draining from the eyes. Tears help keep the surface of the eye moist. They wash away particles and foreign objects in the eye.Causes

Your eyes always contain tears made by the tear (lacrimal) glands just above the eyes. These tears leave the eye through a small hole in the corner of the eye called the tear duct (nasolacrimal duct). Causes of watery eyes include:Allergy to mold, dander, dustBlepharitis (swelling along the edge of the eyelid)Blockage of the tear ductConjunctivitisSmog or chemicals in the air or windBright lightEyelid turning inward or outwardSomething in the eye (such as dust or sand)Scrape on the eyeInfectionInward-growing eyelashesIrritation Increased tearing sometimes happens with:EyestrainLaughingVomitingYawningOne of the most common causes of excess tearing is dry eyes. Drying causes the eyes to become uncomfortable, which stimulates the body to produce too many tears. One of the main tests for diagnosing excess tearing is to check whether the eyes are too dry.Home Care

Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. Therefore, it is important to determine the cause before treating yourself at home. When to Contact a Medical Professional

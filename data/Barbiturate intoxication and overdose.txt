 Barbiturates are medicines that cause relaxation and sleepiness. A barbiturate overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. An overdose is life threatening. At fairly low doses, barbiturates may make you seem drunk or intoxicated. Barbiturates are addictive. People who use them become physically dependent on them. Stopping them suddenly (withdrawal) can be life-threatening. Tolerance to the mood-altering effects of barbiturates develops rapidly with repeated use. But, tolerance to the lethal effects develops more slowly, and the risk of severe poisoning increases with continued use.This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.Causes

Barbiturate use is a major addiction problem for many people. Most people who take these medicines for seizure disorders or pain syndromes do not abuse them, but those who do, usually start by using medicine that was prescribed for them or other family members.Most overdoses of this type of medicine involve a mixture of medicines, usually alcohol and barbiturates, or barbiturates andÂ opioids such as heroin, oxycodone, or fentanyl.Some users take a combination of all these medicines. Those who use such combinations tend to be:New users who do not know these combinations can lead to coma or deathExperienced users who use them on purpose to alter their consciousness Symptoms

This medicine often rapidly restores consciousness and breathing in people with an opioid overdose, but its action is short-lived, and may need to be given repeatedly.There is no direct antidote for barbiturates. An antidote is a medicine that reverses the effects of another medicine or drug.In select and extreme cases of overdose, dialysis (kidney machine) may be used to help remove the medicine from the blood.Outlook (Prognosis)

About 1 in 10 people who overdose on barbiturates or a mixture that contains barbiturates will die. They usually die from heart and lung problems. Possible Complications

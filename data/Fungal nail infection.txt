 Fungal nail infection is a fungus growing in and around your fingernail or toenail.Causes

Fungi can live on the dead tissues of the hair, nails, and outer skin layers.Common fungal infections include:Athlete's footJock itchRingworm on the skin of the body or head Fungal nail infections often start after a fungal infection on the feet. They occur more often in toenails than in fingernails. They are most often seen in adults as they age.You are at higher risk of getting a fungal nail infection if you have any of the following:DiabetesPeripheral vascular diseasePeripheral neuropathiesMinor skin or nail injuriesDeformed nail or nail diseaseMoist skin for a long timeImmune system problemsFamily historyWear footwear that does not allow air to reach your feetSymptoms

Symptoms include nail changes on one or more nails (usually toenails), such as: BrittlenessChange in nail shapeCrumbling of the outside edges of the nailDebris trapped under the nailLoosening or lifting of the nailLoss of luster and shine on the nail surfaceThickening of the nailWhite or yellow streaks on the side of the nail Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine your nails to find out if you have a fungal infection. The diagnosis can be confirmed by looking at scrapings from the nail under a microscope. This can help determine the type of fungus. Samples can also be sent to a lab for a culture. (Results may take 4 to 6 weeks.)Treatment

Over-the-counter creams and ointments usually do not help treat this condition.Prescription antifungal medicines that you take by mouth may help clear the fungus.You will need to take the medicine for about 2 to 3 months for toenails; a shorter time for fingernails.Your provider will do lab tests to check for liver damage while you are taking these medicines. Laser treatments may sometimes get rid of the fungus in the nails. This is less effective than medicines.In some cases, you may need to have the nail removed.Outlook (Prognosis)

The fungal nail infection is cured by the growth of new, non-infected nails. Nails grow slowly. Even if treatment is successful, it may take up to a year for a new clear nail to grow.Fungal nail infections may be hard to treat. Medicines clear up fungus in about one half of the people who try them.Even when treatment works, the fungus may return.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Bacterial gastroenteritis occurs when there is an infection of your stomach and intestines. This is due to bacteria.Causes

Bacterial gastroenteritis can affect one person or a group of people who all ate the same food. It is commonly called food poisoning. It often occurs after eating at picnics, school cafeterias, large social gatherings, or restaurants.Your food may get infected in many ways:Meat or poultry may come into contact with bacteria when the animal is processed.Water that is used during growing or shipping may contain animal or human waste.Improper food handling or preparation may occur in grocery stores, restaurants, or homes.Food poisoning often occurs from eating or drinking:Food prepared by someone who did not wash their hands properlyFood prepared using unclean cooking utensils, cutting boards, or other toolsDairy products or food containing mayonnaise (such as coleslaw or potato salad) that have been out of the refrigerator too longFrozen or refrigerated foods that are not stored at the proper temperature or are not reheated properlyRaw shellfish such as oysters or clamsRaw fruits or vegetables that have not been washed well Raw vegetable or fruit juices and dairy products (look for the word "pasteurized" to make sure the food is safe to eat or drink)Undercooked meats or eggsWater from a well or stream, or city or town water that has not been treatedMany different types of bacteria can cause bacterial gastroenteritis, including:Campylobacter jejuniE coliSalmonellaShigellaStaphylococcusYersiniaSymptoms

Symptoms depend on the type of bacteria that caused the sickness. All types of food poisoning cause diarrhea. Other symptoms include:Abdominal crampsAbdominal painBloody stoolsLoss of appetiteNausea and vomitingFeverExams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine you for signs of food poisoning. These may include pain in the stomach and signs your body does not have as much water and fluids as it should (dehydration).Lab tests may be done on the food or a stool sample to find out what germ is causing your symptoms. However, these tests do not always show the cause of the diarrhea.Tests may also be done to look for white blood cells in the stool. This is a sign of infection.Treatment

You will most likely recover from the most common types of bacterial gastroenteritis in a couple of days. The goal is to make you feel better and avoid dehydration.Drinking enough fluids and learning what to eat will help ease symptoms. You may need to:Manage the diarrheaControl nausea and vomitingGet plenty of restIf you have diarrhea and are unable to drink or keep down fluids because of nausea or vomiting, you may need fluids through a vein (IV). Young children may be at extra risk of getting dehydrated.If you take diuretics ("water pills"), or ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure, talk to your provider. You may need to stop taking these medicines while you have diarrhea. Never stop or change your medicines without first talking to your provider.Antibiotics are not given very often for most common types of bacterial gastroenteritis. If diarrhea is very severe or you have a weak immune system, antibiotics may be needed.You can buy medicines at the drugstore that can help stop or slow diarrhea. Do not use these medicines without talking to your provider if you have:Bloody diarrheaSevere diarrheaFever Do not give these medicines to children.Outlook (Prognosis)

 Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare disease in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal.Causes

People with this disease have blood cells that are missing a gene called PIG-A. This gene allows a substance called glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) to help certain proteins stick to cells.Without PIG-A, important proteins cannot connect to the cell surface and protect the cell from substances in the blood called complement. As a result, red blood cells break down too early. The red cells leak hemoglobin into the blood, which can pass into the urine. This can happen at any time, but is more likely to occur during the night or early morning.The disease can affect people of any age. It may be associated with aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myelogenous leukemia.Risk factors, except for prior aplastic anemia, are not known.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Abdominal painBack painBlood clots, may form in some peopleDark urine, comes and goesEasy bruising or bleedingHeadacheShortness of breathWeakness, fatiguePallorChest painDifficulty swallowingExams and Tests

Red and white blood cell counts and platelet counts may be low.Red or brown urine signals the breakdown of red blood cells and that hemoglobin is being released into the body's circulation and eventually into the urine.Tests that may be done to diagnose this condition include:Complete blood count (CBC)Coombs testFlow cytometry to measure certain proteinsHam (acid hemolysin) testSerum hemoglobin and haptoglobinSucrose hemolysis testUrinalysisUrine hemosiderin, urobilinogen, hemoglobinLDH testReticulocyte countTreatment

Steroids or other medicines that suppress the immune system may help slow the breakdown of red blood cells. Blood transfusions may be needed. Supplemental iron and folic acid are provided. Blood thinners may also be needed to prevent clots from forming.Soliris (eculizumab) is a drug used to treat PNH. It blocks the breakdown of red blood cells.Bone marrow transplantation can cure this disease. It may also stop the risk for developing PNH in people with aplastic anemia.All people with PNH should receive vaccinations against certain types of bacteria to prevent infection. Ask your health care provider which ones are right for you.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome varies. Most people survive for more than 10 years after their diagnosis. Death can result from complications such as blood clot formation (thrombosis) or bleeding.In rare cases, the abnormal cells may decrease over time.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Acute myelogenous leukemiaAplastic anemiaBlood clotsDeathHemolytic anemiaIron deficiency anemiaMyelodysplasia When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you find blood in your urine, if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms develop.Prevention

There is no known way to prevent this disorder.Alternative Names

Blood and urine tests will be done. The person may receive:Activated charcoal to prevent the rest of the poison from getting absorbed into the stomach and digestive tract.Airway and breathing support, including oxygen. In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent aspiration.Â A breathing machine (ventilator) would then be needed.Calcium (an antidote), to reverse the effect of the poison.Chest x-ray.ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing).Endoscopy: a camera down the throat to see burns to the esophagus and stomach.Fluids through a vein (by IV).Medicines to treat symptoms.Tube through the mouth (rare) into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage).

You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come in contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets. Cats are common carriers.The fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm, moist areas.

 Sensorineural deafness is a type of hearing loss. It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the place of origin of the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or the brain.Considerations

Symptoms may include:Some sounds seem overly loud in one ear.You have problems following conversations when two or more people are talking.You have problems hearing in noisy areas.It is easier to hear men's voices than women's voices.It is hard to tell high-pitched sounds (such as "s" or "th") from one another.Other people's voices sound mumbled or slurred.You have problems hearing when there is background noise.Associated symptoms may include:Feeling of being off-balance or dizzy (more common with Meniere disease and acoustic neuromas)Ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus) Causes

The inner part of the ear contains tiny hair cells (nerve endings), that change sounds into electric signals. The nerves then carry these signals to the brain.Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by damage to these special cells, or to the nerve fibers in the inner ear. Sometimes, the hearing loss is caused by damage to the nerve that carries the signals to the brain.Sensorineural deafness that is present at birth (congenital) is most often due to:Genetic syndromesInfections that the mother passes to her baby in the womb (toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes)SNHL may develop in children or adults later in life (acquired) as a result of:Age-related hearing lossDisease of the blood vesselsImmune diseaseInfections, such as meningitis, mumps, scarlet fever, and measlesInjury of the ear or headLoud noises or sounds, or loud sounds that last for a long timeMeniere diseaseTumor, such as acoustic neuromaUse of certain medicinesWorking around loud noises every dayIn some cases, the cause is unknown.What to Expect at Your Office Visit

The goal of treatment is to improve your hearing. The following may be helpful:Hearing aidsTelephone amplifiers and other assistive devicesSafety and alert systems for your homeSign language (for those with severe hearing loss)Speech reading (such as lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication)A cochlear implant may be recommended for certain people with severe hearing loss. Surgery is done to place the implant. The implant makes sounds seem louder, but does not restore normal hearing.You will also learn strategies for living with hearing loss and advice to share with those around you for talking to someone with hearing loss.Alternative Names

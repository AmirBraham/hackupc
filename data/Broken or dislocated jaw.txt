 A broken jaw is a break (fracture) in the jaw bone. A dislocated jaw means the lower part of the jaw has moved out of its normal position at one or both joints where the jaw bone connects to the skull (temporomandibular joints). A jaw bone joint is called the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).Considerations

A broken or dislocated jaw usually heals well after treatment. But the jaw may become dislocated again in the future.Complications may include:Airway blockageBleedingBreathing blood or food into the lungsDifficulty eating (temporary)Difficulty talking (temporary)Infection of the jaw or facePain of the jaw joint (TMJ) pain and other problemsNumbness of part of the jaw or faceProblems aligning the teethSwellingCauses

The most common cause of a broken or dislocated jaw is injury to the face. This may be due to:AssaultIndustrial accidentMotor vehicle accidentRecreational or sports injuryTrips and fallsAfter a dental or medical procedureSymptoms

Symptoms of a broken jaw include:Pain in the face or jaw, located in front of the ear or on the affected side, that gets worse with movementBruising and swelling of the face, bleeding from the mouthDifficulty chewingMisaligned teeth or jawJaw stiffness, difficulty opening the mouth widely, or problem closing the mouthJaw moving to one side when openingJaw tenderness or pain, worse with biting or chewingLoose or damaged teethLump or abnormal appearance of the cheek or jawNumbness of the face (particularly the lower lip)Ear painSymptoms of a dislocated jaw include:Pain in the face or jaw, located in front of the ear or on the affected side that gets worse with movementBite that feels "off" or crookedProblems talkingInability to close the mouthDrooling because of inability to close the mouthLocked jaw or jaw that protrudes forwardTeeth that do not line up properlyFirst Aid

A person with a broken or dislocated jaw needs medical attention right away. This is because they may have breathing problems or bleeding. Call 911 or the local emergency number or a local hospital for further advice.Hold the jaw gently in place with your hands on the way to the emergency room. You can also wrap a bandage under the jaw and over the top of the head. The bandage should be easy to remove in case you need to vomit.At the hospital, if you have breathing problems, heavy bleeding occurs, or severe swelling of your face, a tube may be placed into your airway to help you breathe.FRACTURED JAWTreatment for a fractured jaw depends on how badly the bone is broken. If you have a minor fracture, it can heal on its own. You may only need pain medicines. You will probably have to eat soft foods or stay on a liquid diet for a while.Surgery is often needed for moderate to severe fractures. The jaw may be wired to the teeth of the opposite jaw to keep the jaw stable while it heals. Jaw wires are usually left in place for 6 to 8 weeks. Small rubber bands (elastics) are used to hold the teeth together. After a few weeks, some of the elastics are removed to allow motion and reduce joint stiffness.If the jaw is wired, you can only drink liquids or eat very soft foods. Have blunt scissors readily available to cut the elastics in the event of vomiting or choking. If the wires must be cut, call your health care provider right away so that the wires can be replaced.DISLOCATED JAWIf your jaw is dislocated, a doctor may be able to place it back into the correct position using the thumbs. Numbing medicines (anesthetics) and muscle relaxants may be needed to relax the jaw muscles.Afterward, your jaw may need to be stabilized. This usually involves bandaging the jaw to keep the mouth from opening widely. In some cases, surgery is needed to do this, particularly if repeated jaw dislocations occur.After dislocating your jaw, you should not open your mouth widely for at least 6 weeks. Support your jaw with one or both hands when yawning and sneezing.DO NOT

Do not try to correct the position of the jaw. A doctor should do this.When to Contact a Medical Professional

A broken or dislocated jaw requires prompt medical attention. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing or heavy bleeding. Prevention

During work, sports, and recreation activities, using safety equipment, such as a helmet when playing football, or using mouth guards can prevent or minimize some injuries to the face or jaw.Alternative Names

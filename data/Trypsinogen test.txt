 Trypsinogen is a substance that is normally produced in the pancreas and released into the small intestine. Trypsinogen is converted to trypsin. Then it starts the process needed to break down proteins into their building blocks (called amino acids).A test can be done to measure the amount of trypsinogen in your blood.How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is taken from a vein. The blood sample is sent to a lab for testing.How to Prepare for the Test

There are no special preparations. You may be asked to not eat or drink for 8 hours before the test.How the Test will Feel

You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.Why the Test is Performed

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Increased levels of trypsinogen may be due to:Abnormal production of pancreatic enzymesAcute pancreatitisCystic fibrosisPancreatic cancerVery low levels may be seen in people withÂ chronic pancreatitis.Risks

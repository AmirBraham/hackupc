 Open gallbladder removal is surgery to remove the gallbladder through a large cut in your abdomen.The gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which your body uses to digest fats in the small intestine.Description

Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free. To perform the surgery:Your surgeon makes a 5 to 7 inch (12.5 to 17.5 centimeters) cut in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs.The area is opened up so your surgeon can view the gallbladder and separate it from the other organs.Your surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder.The gallbladder is gently lifted out and removed from your body. An x-ray called a cholangiogram may be done during your surgery. To do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be inside the common bile duct.If other stones are found, your surgeon will remove them with a special instrument. The surgery takes about 1 to 2 hours.Why the Procedure is Performed

You may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally.Common symptoms may include:Indigestion, including bloating, heartburn, and gas Nausea and vomitingPain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain) The most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Open gallbladder surgery is used when laparoscopic surgery cannot be done safely. In some cases, the surgeon needs to switch to an open surgery if laparoscopic surgery cannot be successfully continued.Other reasons for removing the gallbladder by open surgery:Unexpected bleeding during the laparoscopic operationObesityInflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)Pregnancy (third trimester)Severe liver problemsPast surgeries in the same area of your belly Risks

Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:Reactions to medicinesBreathing problemsBleeding, blood clotsInfectionRisks of gallbladder surgery are:Damage to the blood vessels that go to the liverInjury to the common bile ductInjury to the small or large intestineInflammation of the pancreasBefore the Procedure

You may need to stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days after open gallbladder removal. During that time:You may be asked to breathe into a device called an incentive spirometer. This helps keep your lungs working well so that you do not get pneumonia.Your nurse will help you sit up in bed, hang your legs over the side, and then stand up and start to walk.At first, you will receive fluids into your vein through an intravenous (IV) tube. Soon after, you will be asked to start drinking liquids and eating foods.You will be able to shower while you are still in the hospital.You may be asked to wear pressure stockings on your legs to help prevent a blood clot from forming.If there were problems during your surgery, or if you have bleeding, a lot of pain, or a fever, you may need to stay in the hospital longer. Your surgeon or nurses will tell you how to care for yourself after you leave the hospital.Outlook (Prognosis)

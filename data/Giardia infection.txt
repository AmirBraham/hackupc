 Giardia, or giardiasis, is a parasitic infection of the small intestine. A tiny parasite called Giardia lamblia causes it.Causes

The giardia parasite lives in soil, food, and water. It may also be found on surfaces that have come into contact with animal or human waste. You may become infected if you: Are exposed to a family member with giardiasisDrink water from lakes or streams where animals such as beavers and muskrats, or domestic animals such as sheep, have left their wasteEat raw or undercooked food that has been contaminated with the parasiteHave direct person-to-person contact in daycare centers, long-term care homes, or nursing homes with people who are infected with the parasiteHave unprotected anal sexTravelers are at risk for giardiasis throughout the world. Campers and hikers are at risk if they drink untreated water from streams and lakes. Symptoms

The time between becoming infected and symptoms is 7 to 14 days. Non-bloody diarrhea is the main symptom. Other symptoms include:Abdominal gas or bloatingHeadacheLoss of appetiteLow-grade feverNauseaWeight loss and loss of body fluidsSome people who have had a giardia infection for a long time continue having symptoms, even after the infection is gone. Exams and Tests

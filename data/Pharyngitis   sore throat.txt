 Exams and Tests

Most sore throats are caused by viruses. Antibiotics do not help viral sore throats. Using these medicines when they are not needed may lead to antibiotics not working as well when they are needed.Sore throat is treated with antibiotics if: A strep test or culture is positive. Your provider cannot diagnose strep throat by symptoms or a physical exam alone.A culture for chlamydia or gonorrhea is positive.Sore throat caused by the flu (influenza) may be helped by antiviral medicines.The following tips may help your sore throat feel better:Drink soothing liquids. You can either drink warm liquids, such as lemon tea with honey, or cold liquids, such as ice water. You could also suck on a fruit-flavored ice pop.Gargle several times a day with warm salt water (1/2 tsp or 3 grams of salt in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water).Suck on hard candies or throat lozenges. Young children should not be given these products because they can choke on them.Use of a cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier can moisten the air and soothe a dry and painful throat.Try over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).

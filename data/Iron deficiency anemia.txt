 Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types and causes of anemia.Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body does not have enough iron. Iron helps make red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia.Causes

Red blood cells bring oxygen to your body's tissues. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells.Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron to make hemoglobin, your blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because:You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replaceYour body does not absorb iron wellYour body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods that contain ironYour body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding) Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are:Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periodsCancer in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or colonEsophageal varices, often from cirrhosisThe use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or medicines that may thin the blood for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleedingPeptic ulcer diseaseYour body may not absorb enough iron in your diet due to:Celiac diseaseCrohn diseaseGastric bypass surgeryTaking too many antacids or too much of the antibiotic tetracycline You may not get enough iron in your diet if:You are a strict vegetarianYou do not eat enough foods that contain iron Symptoms

You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild.Most of the time, symptoms are mild at first and develop slowly. Symptoms may include:Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exerciseHeadachesDizzinessPalpitationsProblems concentrating or thinking As the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:Brittle nailsBlue color to the whites of the eyeDesire to eat ice or other non-food things (pica)Feeling lightheaded when you stand upPale skin colorShortness of breathSore or inflamed tongueMouth ulcersUncontrolled movement of legs (during sleep)Hair lossSymptoms of the conditions associated with bleeding that cause iron deficiency anemia include:Dark, tar-colored stools or blood in the stoolHeavy menstrual bleedingPain in the upper belly (from ulcers)Exams and Tests

To diagnose anemia, your health care provider may order these blood tests:Complete blood count (CBC)Reticulocyte count To check iron levels, your provider may order:Serum iron levelTotal iron binding capacity (TIBC) in the bloodSerum ferritinBone marrow biopsy (if the diagnosis is not clear)To check for causes of blood loss, your provider may order:ColonoscopyFecal occult blood testUpper endoscopyTests to detect sources of blood loss in the urinary tract or uterus Treatment

Treatment may include taking iron supplements and eating iron-rich foods.Iron supplements (most often ferrous sulfate) build up the iron stores in your body. Most of the time, your provider will measure your iron level before you start supplements.If you cannot take iron by mouth, you may need to take it through a vein (intravenous) or by an injection into the muscle.Pregnant and breastfeeding women will need to take extra iron because they often cannot get enough iron from their normal diet.Often your anemia will improve or resolve with 6 weeks of iron therapy. You will need to keep taking iron for another 6 months to replace your body's iron stores in your bone marrow.Iron supplements are mostly well tolerated, but may cause:NauseaVomitingConstipation Iron-rich foods include:Chicken and turkeyDried lentils, peas, and beansFishMeats (liver is the highest source)Soybeans, baked beans, chickpeasWhole-grain bread Other sources include:OatmealRaisins, prunes, apricots, and peanutsSpinach, kale, and other greens Vitamin C helps your body to absorb iron.

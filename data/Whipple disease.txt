 Whipple disease is a rare condition that mainly affects the small intestine. This prevents the small intestine from allowing nutrients to pass into the rest of the body. This is called malabsorption.Causes

Whipple disease is caused by infection with bacterium called Tropheryma whipplei. The disorder mainly affects white men of middle-age.Whipple disease is rare. Risk factors are not known.Symptoms

Symptoms most often start slowly. Joint pain is the most common early symptom. Symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) infection often occur several years later. Other symptoms may include:Abdominal painDiarrheaFeverDarkening of skin in light-exposed areas of bodyJoint pain in the ankles, knees, elbows, fingers, or other areasMemory lossMental changesWeight loss Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show:Enlarged lymph glandsHeart murmurSwelling in body tissues (edema) Tests to diagnose Whipple disease may include:Complete blood count (CBC)Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to check for the bacteria that cause the diseaseSmall bowel biopsyUpper GI endoscopy (viewing the intestines with a flexible, lighted tube in a process called enteroscopy) This disease may also change the results of the following tests:Albumin levels in the blood
   
   Unabsorbed fat in the stools (fecal fat)
   Intestinal absorption of a type of sugar (d-xylose absorption) Treatment

People with Whipple disease need to take long-term antibiotics to cure the infection that may include sites in the brain and central nervous system. An antibiotic called ceftriaxone is given through a vein (IV). It is followed by another antibiotic (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) taken by mouth for up to 1 year.If symptoms come back during antibiotic use, the medicines may be changed.Your provider should closely follow your progress. Symptoms of the disease can return after you finish the treatments. People who remain malnourished will also need to take dietary supplements.Outlook (Prognosis)

If not treated, the condition is most often fatal. Treatment relieves symptoms and can cure the disease.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Brain damageHeart valve damage (from endocarditis)Nutritional deficienciesSymptoms return (which may be because of drug resistance)Weight lossWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a disorder in which tumors form on the nerves of the brain and spine (the central nervous system). It may be passed down (inherited) in families.Although it has a similar name to neurofibromatosis type 1, it is a different and separate condition.Causes

NF2 is caused by a mutation in the gene NF2. NF2 can be passed down through families in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that if one parent has NF2, any child of that parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.Some cases of NF2 occur when the gene mutates on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited.Symptoms

Symptoms of NF2 include:Balance problemsCataracts at a young ageChanges in visionCoffee-colored marks on the skin (café-au-lait), less commonHeadachesHearing lossRinging and noises in the earsWeakness of the face Exams and Tests

Signs of NF2 include:Brain and spinal tumorsHearing-related (acoustic) tumorsSkin tumors Tests include:Physical examinationMedical historyMRICT scanGenetic testingTreatment

Acoustic tumors can be observed, or treated with surgery or radiation.People with this disorder may benefit from genetic counseling.People with NF2 should be regularly evaluated with these tests:MRI of the brain and spinal cordHearing and speech evaluationEye examSupport Groups

 Meningitis is present when the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord become swollen and inflamed. This covering is called the meninges.Bacteria are one type of germ that may cause meningitis. Gram-negative bacteria are a type of bacteria that behave in a similar manner in the body. They are called gram-negative because they turn pink when tested in the laboratory with a special stain called Gram stain.Causes

Acute bacterial meningitis can be caused by different Gram-negative bacteria including meningococcus and H influenzae.This article covers Gram-negative meningitis caused by the following bacteria:Escherichia coliKlebsiella pneumoniaePseudomonas aeruginosaSerratia marcescensGram-negative meningitis is more common in infants than adults. But it can also occur in adults, especially those with one or more risk factors. Risk factors in adults and children include:Infection (especially in the abdomen or urinary tract)Recent brain surgeryRecent injury to the head
   Spinal abnormalities
   
   Spinal fluid shunt placement after brain surgery
   
   Urinary tract abnormalities
   Urinary tract infection
   Weakened immune system
   Symptoms

Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include: 
 Fever and chillsMental status changesNausea and vomitingSensitivity to light (photophobia)Severe headacheStiff neck (meningismus)Symptoms of a bladder, kidney, intestine, or lung infectionOther symptoms that can occur with this disease:AgitationBulging fontanelles in infantsDecreased consciousnessPoor feeding or irritability in childrenRapid breathingUnusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards (opisthotonos)Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Questions will focus on symptoms and possible exposure to someone who might have the same symptoms, such as a stiff neck and fever.If the provider thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) will likely be done to remove a sample of spinal fluid for testing.Other tests that may be done include:Blood cultureChest x-rayCT scan of the headGram stain or, other special stains, and culture of the spinal fluidTreatment

Antibiotics will be started as soon as possible. Ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime are the most commonly used antibiotics for this type of meningitis. Other antibiotics may be given, depending on the type of bacteria. If you have a spinal shunt, it may be removed.Outlook (Prognosis)

The earlier treatment is started, the better the outcome.Many people recover completely. But, many people have permanent brain damage or die of this type of meningitis. Young children and adults over age 50 have the higher risk for death. How well you do depends on:Your ageHow soon treatment is startedYour overall healthPossible Complications

Long-term complications may include:Brain damageBuildup of fluid between the skull and brain (subdural effusion)Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus)Hearing lossSeizuresWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:
   Feeding problems
   
   High-pitched cry
   
   Irritability
   
   Persistent unexplained fever
   Meningitis can quickly become a life-threatening illness.Prevention

Prompt treatment of related infections may reduce the severity and complications of meningitis.Images

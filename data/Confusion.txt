 Confusion is the inability to think as clearly or quickly as you normally do. You may feel disoriented and have difficulty paying attention, remembering, and making decisions.Considerations

Confusion may come on quickly or slowly over time, depending on the cause. Many times, confusion lasts for a short time and goes away. Other times, it is permanent and not curable. It may be associated with delirium or dementia.Confusion is more common in older people and often occurs during a hospital stay.Some confused people may have strange or unusual behavior or may act aggressively.Causes

For safety, the person may need someone nearby to calm them and protect them from injury.

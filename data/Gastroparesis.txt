 Gastroparesis is a condition that reduces the ability of the stomach to empty its contents. It does not involve a blockage (obstruction).Causes

It can also follow some surgeries.Risk factors for gastroparesis include:DiabetesGastrectomy (surgery to remove part of the stomach)Systemic sclerosisUse of medicine that blocks certain nerve signals (anticholinergic medicine) Symptoms

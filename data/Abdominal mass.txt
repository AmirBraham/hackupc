 An abdominal mass is swelling in one part of the belly area (abdomen).Considerations

An abdominal mass is often found during a routine physical exam. Most of the time, the mass develops slowly. You may not be able to feel the mass.Locating the mass helps your health care provider make a diagnosis. For example, the abdomen can be divided into four areas:Right-upper quadrantLeft-upper quadrantRight-lower quadrantLeft-lower quadrantOther terms used to describe the location of abdominal pain or masses include:Epigastric -- center of the abdomen just below the rib cagePeriumbilical -- area around the belly button The location of the mass and its firmness, texture, and other qualities can provide clues to its cause.Causes

Several conditions can cause an abdominal mass:Abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause a pulsating mass around the navel.Bladder distention (urinary bladder over-filled with fluid) can cause a firm mass in the center of the lower abdomen above the pelvic bones. In extreme cases, it can reach as far up as the navel.Cholecystitis can cause a very tender mass that is felt below the liver in the right-upper quadrant (occasionally).Colon cancer can cause a mass almost anywhere in the abdomen.Crohn disease or bowel obstruction can cause many tender, sausage-shaped masses anywhere in the abdomen.Diverticulitis can cause a mass that is usually located in the left-lower quadrant.Gallbladder tumor can cause a tender, irregularly shaped mass in the right-upper quadrant.Hydronephrosis (fluid-filled kidney) can cause a smooth, spongy-feeling mass in one or both sides or toward the back (flank area).Kidney cancer can sometimes cause a smooth, firm, but not tender mass in the abdomen.Liver cancer can cause a firm, lumpy mass in the right upper quadrant.Liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) can cause a firm, irregular mass below the right rib cage, or on the left side in the stomach area.Neuroblastoma, a cancerous tumor often found in the lower abdomen can cause a mass (this cancer mainly occurs in children and infants).Ovarian cyst can cause a smooth, rounded, rubbery mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen.Pancreatic abscess can cause a mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.Pancreatic pseudocyst can cause a lumpy mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.Spleen enlargement (splenomegaly) can sometimes be felt in the left-upper quadrant.Stomach cancer can cause a mass in the left-upper abdomen in the stomach area (epigastric) if the cancer is large.Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) can cause a round, lumpy mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen (sometimes can be felt if the fibroids are large).Volvulus can cause a mass anywhere in the abdomen.Ureteropelvic junction obstruction can cause a mass in the lower abdomen.

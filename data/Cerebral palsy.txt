 Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that involve the brain. This affects nervous system functions, such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking.There are several different types of CP, including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic, and mixed.Causes

CP is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb. But they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.In some people with cerebral palsy, parts of the brain are injured due to a low level of oxygen (hypoxia) in those areas. It is not known why this occurs.Premature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP. It may also occur in early infancy as a result of certain conditions such as:Bleeding in the brainBrain infections (encephalitis, meningitis, herpes simplex infections)Head injuryInfections in the mother during pregnancy (rubella)Untreated jaundiceInjuries to the brain during the childbirth process Exposure to toxins while developing (mercury)In some cases, the cause of CP is never determined.Symptoms

Symptoms of CP can be very different between people with this group of disorders. Symptoms may:Be very mild or very severeOnly involve one side of the body or both sidesBe more pronounced in either the arms or legs, or involve both the arms and legs Symptoms are usually seen before a child is 2 years old. Sometimes symptoms begin as early as 3 months. Parents may notice that their child is delayed in reaching developmental stages such as sitting, rolling, crawling, or walking.There are several different types of cerebral palsy. Some people have a mix of symptoms.Spastic CP is the most common type. Symptoms include:Muscles that are very tight and do not stretch. They may tighten even more over time.Abnormal walk (gait) -- arms tucked in toward the sides, knees crossed or touching, legs make "scissors" movements, walk on the toes.Joints are tight and do not open all the way (called joint contracture).Muscle weakness or loss of movement in a group of muscles (paralysis).Symptoms may affect one arm or leg, one side of the body, both legs, or both arms and legs. The following symptoms may occur in other types of CP:Abnormal movements (twisting, jerking, or writhing) of the hands, feet, arms, or legs while awake, which gets worse during periods of stressTremorsUnsteady gaitLoss of coordinationFloppy muscles, especially at rest, and joints that move around too much Other brain and nervous system symptoms may include:Learning disabilities are common, but intelligence can be normalSpeech problems (dysarthria)Hearing or vision problemsSeizuresPain, especially in adults, which can be difficult to manage Eating and digestion symptoms:Difficulty sucking or feeding in infants, or chewing and swallowing in older children and adultsVomiting or constipation Other symptoms:Increased droolingSlower than normal growthIrregular breathingUrinary incontinenceExams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a full neurologic exam. In older people, testing cognitive function is also important.Other tests may be performed as needed, most often to rule out other disorders:Blood testsCT scan of the headCranial ultrasound (especially in pre-term infants)Electroencephalogram (EEG)Hearing screenMRI of the headVision testing Treatment

There is no cure for CP. The goal of treatment is to help the person be as independent as possible.Treatment requires a team approach, including:Primary care providerDentist (dental check-ups are recommended around every 6 months)Social workerNursesOccupational, physical, and speech therapistsOther specialists, including a neurologist, rehabilitation physician (physiatrist), pulmonologist, and gastroenterologist Treatment is based on the person's symptoms and the need to prevent complications.Self and home care include:Getting enough food and nutritionKeeping the home safePerforming exercises recommended by the providersPracticing proper bowel care (stool softeners, fluids, fiber, laxatives, regular bowel habits)Protecting the joints from injury Putting the child in regular schools is recommended unless physical disabilities or mental development makes this impossible. Special education or schooling may help.The following may help with communication and learning:GlassesHearing aidsMuscle and bone bracesWalking aidsWheelchairs Physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthopedic help, or other treatments may also be needed to help with daily activities and care.Medicines may include:Anticonvulsants to prevent or reduce the frequency of seizuresBotulinum toxin to help with spasticity and droolingMuscle relaxants to reduce tremors and spasticity Surgery may be needed in some cases to:Control gastroesophageal refluxCut certain nerves from the spinal cord to help with pain and spasticityPlace a pump for medicine administration into spinal canalPlace a feeding tubeRelease joint contractures Shockwave therapy to reduce spasticity is being investigated.Support Groups

Stress and burnout among parents and other caregivers of people with cerebral palsy is common. Seek support and more information from organizations that specialize in CP.Outlook (Prognosis)

CP is a life-long disorder. Long-term care may be required. The disorder does not affect expected length of life. The amount of disability varies. Babies with mild CP may outgrow their symptoms.Many adults are able to live in the community, either independently or with different levels of help.Possible Complications

CP may lead to the following health problems:Bone thinning (osteoporosis)Bowel obstructionHip dislocation and arthritis in the hip jointInjuries from fallsPressure soresJoint contracturesPneumonia caused by chokingPoor nutritionReduced communication skills (sometimes)Reduced intellect (sometimes)ScoliosisSeizures (in about half of the people who are affected by cerebral palsy)Social stigma When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if symptoms of CP develop, especially if you know that an injury occurred during birth or early infancy.Prevention

Getting the proper prenatal care may reduce the risk for some rare causes of CP. In most cases though, the injury causing the disorder is not preventable.Pregnant mothers with certain medical conditions may need to be followed in a high-risk prenatal clinic.Adults with CP should continue to follow-up with a neurologist to reduce the risk of late complications.Alternative Names

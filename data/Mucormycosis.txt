 Mucormycosis is a fungal infection of the sinuses, brain, or lungs. It occurs in some people with a weakened immune system.Causes

Mucormycosis is caused by different kinds of fungi that are often found in decaying organic matter. These include spoiled bread, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and compost piles. Most people come in contact with the fungus in the environment.People with a weakened immune system are more likely to develop mucormycosis. These include people with any of the following conditions:AIDSBurnsDiabetes (usually poorly controlled)Leukemia and lymphomaLong-term steroid useMetabolic acidosisPoor nutrition (malnutrition)Use of some medicines that suppress the immune systemMucormycosis may involve:A sinus and brain infection called rhinocerebral infection: It may start as a sinus infection, and then lead to the swelling of the nerves that come from the brain. It may also cause blood clots that block vessels to the brain.A lung infection called pulmonary mucormycosis: Pneumonia gets worse quickly and may spread to the chest cavity, heart, and brain.Other parts of the body: Mucormycosis of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and kidneys. Symptoms

Symptoms of rhinocerebral mucormycosis include:Eyes that swell and stick out (protrude)Dark scabbing in nasal cavitiesFeverHeadacheMental status changesRedness of skin above sinusesSinus pain or congestion Symptoms of lung (pulmonary) mucormycosis include:CoughCoughing blood (occasionally)FeverShortness of breath Symptoms of gastrointestinal mucormycosis include:Abdominal painBlood in the stoolsDiarrheaVomiting blood Symptoms of kidney (renal) mucormycosis include:FeverPain in the upper abdomen or back Symptoms of skin (cutaneous) mucormycosis include a single, sometimes painful, hardened area of skin that may have a blackened center.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine you. See an ear-nose-throat (ENT) doctor if you are having sinus problems. Testing depends on your symptoms, but may include these imaging tests:CT scansMRI scans A biopsy must be done to diagnose mucormycosis. A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for laboratory examination to identify the fungus and invasion into host tissue.Treatment

Surgery should be done right away to remove all dead and infected tissue. Surgery can lead to disfiguration because it may involve removal of the palate, parts of the nose, or parts of the eye. But, without such aggressive surgery, chances of survival are greatly decreased.You will also receive antifungal medicine, usually amphotericin B, through a vein. After the infection is under control, you may be switched to a different medicine such as posaconazole or isavuconazole.If you have diabetes, it will be important to get your blood sugar in the normal range.Outlook (Prognosis)

Mucormycosis has a very high death rate, even when aggressive surgery is done. Risk of death depends on the area of the body involved and your overall health.Possible Complications

These complications may occur:Blindness (if the optic nerve is involved)Clotting or blockage of brain or lung blood vesselsDeathNerve damage When to Contact a Medical Professional

People with weakened immune systems and immune disorders (including diabetes) should seek medical attention if they develop: Fever Headache Sinus pain Eye swelling Any of the other symptoms listed abovePrevention

Because the fungi that cause mucormycosis are widespread, the best way to prevent this infection is to improve control of the illnesses associated with mucormycosis.Alternative Names

 Alcoholic neuropathy is damage to the nerves that results from excessive drinking of alcohol.Causes

The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. It likely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved.Symptoms

Symptoms of this condition include any of the following: Numbness in the arms and legsAbnormal sensations, such as "pins and needles"Painful sensations in the arms and legsMuscle problems, including weakness, cramps, aches, or spasmsHeat intolerance, especially after exerciseErection problems (impotence)Problems urinating, incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinateConstipation or diarrheaNausea, vomitingProblems swallowing or talkingUnsteady gait (walking)Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems.Excessive alcohol use often makes the body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests will be ordered to check for a deficiency (lack) of:Thiamine (vitamin B1)Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)Vitamin B12Folic acidOther tests may be ordered to check for other possible causes of neuropathy or damage to body systems due to neuropathy.Â Tests may include:Electrolyte levels, including glucose to check for diabetesElectromyography (EMG) to check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the musclesHemoglobin A1c test to check for diabetesLiver and kidney function testsThyroid function testsLevels of vitamins and minerals in the bodyNerve conduction tests to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerveNerve biopsy to remove a small piece of a nerve for examinationUpper GI and small bowel seriesEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestineVoiding cystourethrogram, an x-ray study of the bladder and urethra Treatment

Stopping the use of alcohol is the most important first step. People will often need counseling from alcohol use disorder specialists. If there are other medical problems that can also cause nerve damage, such as diabetes, they should be treated as well. Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include:Controlling symptomsMaximizing ability to function independentlyPreventing injury It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid.Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed to maintain muscle function and limb position.Medicines may be needed to treat pain or uncomfortable sensations due to nerve damage. They will be prescribed the smallest dose of medicine needed to reduce symptoms. This may help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of chronic use.Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may help reduce pain.People with lightheadedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may need to try several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces their symptoms. Treatments that may help include:Wearing compression stockingsEating extra saltSleeping with the head elevatedUsing medicines Bladder problems may be treated with:Manual expression of urineIntermittent catheterization (male or female)Medicines Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy.It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include:Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burnsChanging footwearFrequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoesGuarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure Alcohol must be stopped to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcoholism may include counseling, social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or medicines.Outlook (Prognosis)

Damage to nerves from alcoholic neuropathy is usually permanent. It is likely to get worse if the person continues to use alcohol or if nutritional problems are not corrected. Alcoholic neuropathy is usually not life threatening, but it can severely affect quality of life.When to Contact a Medical Professional

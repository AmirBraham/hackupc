 An RBC count is a blood test that measures how many red blood cells (RBCs) you have.RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein which carries oxygen. How much oxygen your body tissues get depends on how many RBCs you have and how well they work.Watch this video about:Red blood cell productionHow the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is necessary.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.Why the Test is Performed

The RBC count is almost always part of a complete blood count (CBC) test.The test can help diagnose different kinds of anemia (low number of RBCs) and other conditions affecting red blood cells.Other conditions that may require an RBC count are:Bone marrow disorder in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue (myelofibrosis)Disease that damages kidney blood vessels (Alport syndrome)Disorder in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal (hemolysis or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)White blood cell cancer (Waldenström macroglobulinemia)Normal Results

Normal RBC ranges are:Male: 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microliter (cells/mcL)Female: 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcLThe ranges above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Higher than normal numbers of RBCs may be due to:Bone marrow disease that causes abnormal increase in RBCs (polycythemia vera)Cigarette smokingDehydration (for example, from severe diarrhea)Failure of the right side of the heart (cor pulmonale)Kidney tumor (renal cell carcinoma)Low blood oxygen level (hypoxia)Problem with heart's structure and function that is present at birth (congenital heart disease)Scarring or thickening of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis)Your RBC count will increase for several weeks when you are in a higher altitude.Drugs that can increase the RBC count include:Anabolic steroidsErythropoietinGentamicinTestosteroneLower-than-normal numbers of RBCs may be due to:
   Anemia
   BleedingBone marrow cancer called multiple myelomaBone marrow failure (for example, from radiation, toxins, or tumor)Deficiency of a hormone called erythropoietin (caused by kidney disease)LeukemiaMalnutritionPregnancyRBC destruction (hemolysis) due to transfusion, blood vessel injury, or other causeToo little iron, copper, folic acid, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12 in the dietToo much water in the body (overhydration)Drugs that can decrease the RBC count include:Chemotherapy drugsChloramphenicol and certain other antibioticsHydantoinsMethyldopaNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)QuinidineRisks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:Excessive bleedingFainting or feeling lightheadedMultiple punctures to locate veinsHematoma (blood buildup under the skin)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names

Erythrocyte count; Red blood cell count; Anemia - RBC countImages

 Groin pain refers to discomfort in the area where the abdomen ends and the legs begin. This article focuses on groin pain in men. The terms "groin" and "testicle" are sometimes used interchangeably. But what causes pain in one area does not always cause pain in the other.Causes

Common causes of groin pain include:Pulled muscle, tendon, or ligaments in the leg -- This problem often occurs in people who play sports such as hockey, soccer, and football. This condition is sometimes called "sports hernia" although the name is misleading since it is not an actual hernia. It may also involve pain in the testicles. Pain most often improves with rest and medicines.Hernia -- This problem occurs when there is a weak spot in the wall of the abdominal muscle that allows internal organs to press through. Surgery is needed to correct the weak spot.Disease or injury to the hip joint. Less common causes include:Inflammation of the testicle or epididymitis and related structuresTwisting of the spermatic cord that attaches to the testicle (testicular torsion)Tumor of the testicleKidney stoneInflammation of the small or large intestineSkin infectionEnlarged lymph glandsUrinary tract infectionProblem with the artery or vein in the groin (femoral artery or vein)Home Care

 Urinary casts are tiny tube-shaped particles that can be found when urine is examined under the microscope during a test called urinalysis.Urinary casts may be made up of white blood cells, red blood cells, kidney cells, or substances such as protein or fat. The content of a cast can help tell your health care provider whether your kidney is healthy or abnormal.How the Test is Performed

The urine sample you provide may need to be from your first morning urination. The sample needs to be taken to the lab within 1 hour.A clean-catch urine sample is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.How to Prepare for the Test

Delayed or absent tooth formation can result from many different conditions, including:Apert syndromeCleidocranial dysostosisDown syndromeEctodermal dysplasiaEllis-van Creveld syndromeHypothyroidismHypoparathyroidismIncontinentia pigmenti achromiansProgeriaWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Talk to your health care provider if your child has not developed any teeth by 9 months of age.What to Expect at Your Office Visit

The provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at your child's mouth and gums. You will be asked questions such as:In what order did the teeth emerge?At what age did other family members develop teeth?Are any other family members missing teeth that never "came in"?What other symptoms are present? An infant with delayed or absent tooth formation may have other symptoms and signs that indicate a specific medical condition.Medical tests are not often needed. Most of the time, delayed tooth formation is normal. Dental x-rays may be done.Sometimes, children or adults are missing teeth they never developed. Cosmetic or orthodontic dentistry can correct this problem.Alternative Names

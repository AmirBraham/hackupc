 Horner syndrome is a rare condition that affects the nerves to the eye and face.Causes

Horner syndrome can be caused by any interruption in a set of nerve fibers that start in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus and travel to the face and eyes. These nerve fibers are involved with sweating, the pupils in your eyes, and the upper and lower eyelid muscles.Damage of the nerve fibers can result from:Injury to the carotid artery, one of the main arteries to the brainInjury to nerves at the base of the neck called the brachial plexusMigraine or cluster headachesStroke, tumor, or other damage to a part of the brain called the brainstemTumor or infection in the top of the lung, between the lungs, and neckInjections or surgery done to interrupt the nerve fibers and relieve pain (sympathectomy)Spinal cord injuryIn rare cases, Horner syndrome is present at birth. The condition may occur with a lack of color (pigmentation) of the iris (colored part of the eye).Symptoms

Symptoms of Horner syndrome may include:Decreased sweating on the affected side of the faceDrooping eyelid (ptosis)Sinking of the eyeball into the faceDifferent sizes of pupils of the eyes (anisocoria) with the affected side pupil being smallerThere may also be other symptoms, depending on the location of the affected nerve fiber. These may include:Vertigo (sensation that surroundings are spinning) with nausea and vomitingDouble visionLack of muscle control and coordinationArm pain, weakness and numbnessOne sided neck and ear painHoarsenessHearing lossBladder and bowel difficultyOverreaction of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system to stimulation (hyperreflexia)Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.An eye exam may show:Changes in how the pupil opens or closesConstricted pupilEyelid droopingRed eyeDepending on the suspected cause, tests may be done, such as:Blood testsBlood vessel tests of the head (angiogram)Chest x-ray or chest CT scanMRI or CT scan of the brain or cervical spineSpinal tap (lumbar puncture) Electromyography and nerve conduction studies if nerve root or brachial plexus injury suspectedYou may need to be referred to a doctor who specializes in vision problems related to the nervous system (neuro-ophthalmologist).Treatment

Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the condition. There is no treatment for Horner syndrome itself. Ptosis is very mild and in rare cases affects vision in Horner syndrome. This can be corrected by cosmetic surgery or treated with eyedrops. The provider can tell you more.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome depends on whether treatment of the cause is successful.Possible Complications

There are no direct complications of Horner syndrome itself. But, there may be complications from the disease that caused Horner syndrome or from its treatment.When to Contact a Medical Professional

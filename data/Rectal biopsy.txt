 A rectal biopsy is a procedure to remove a small piece of tissue from the rectum for examination.How the Test is Performed

A rectal biopsy is usually part of anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. These are procedures to view inside the rectum.A digital rectal exam is done first. Then, a lubricated instrument (anoscope or proctoscope) is placed into the rectum. You will feel some discomfort when this is done.A biopsy can be taken through any of these instruments.How to Prepare for the Test

You may get a laxative, enema, or other preparation before the biopsy so that you can completely empty your bowel. This will allow the health care provider a clear view of the rectum.How the Test will Feel

There will be some discomfort during the procedure. You may feel like you need to have a bowel movement. You may feel cramping or mild discomfort as the instrument is placed into the rectal area. You may feel a pinch when a biopsy is taken.Why the Test is Performed

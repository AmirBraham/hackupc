 Bronchoscopic culture is a laboratory exam to check a piece of tissue or fluid from the lungs for infection-causing germs.How the Test is Performed

A procedure called bronchoscopy is used to get a sample (biopsy or brush) of lung tissue or fluid.The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture). It is then watched to see if bacteria or other disease-causing germs grow. Treatment is based on the results of the culture.How to Prepare for the Test


 Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for bronchoscopy.How the Test will Feel

Your provider will tell you what to expect during your bronchoscopy. Most times, it's performed under conscious sedation (heavily sedated), or under general anesthesia (fully asleep) so you will likely not remember much from the procedure.Why the Test is Performed

The procedure may find the following things, such as:Abnormal secretionsAbnormal lung tissueAbscessesBlockage of the airway, most often due to cancer or foreign bodiesInflammationObstructive lesions, such as cancer or foreign bodies Normal Results

No organisms are seen on the culture.What Abnormal Results Mean

The results of the culture will help determine the best treatment.Not all organisms found with bronchoscopic culture need to be treated.

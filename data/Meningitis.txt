 Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.Causes

The most common causes of meningitis are viral infections. These infections usually get better without treatment. But, bacterial meningitis infections are very serious. They may result in death or brain damage, even if treated. A lumbar puncture (or spinal tap) is required to determine the specific cause.Meningitis may also be caused by:Chemical irritationDrug allergiesFungiParasitesTumors Many types of viruses can cause meningitis:Enteroviruses: These are viruses that also can cause intestinal illness.Herpes viruses: These are the same viruses that can cause cold sores and genital herpes. However, people with cold sores or genital herpes do not have a higher chance of developing herpes meningitis.HIV.Mumps virus.West Nile virus: This virus is spread by mosquito bites and is an important cause of viral meningitis in most of the United States. Symptoms

Enteroviral meningitis occurs more often than bacterial meningitis and is milder. It usually occurs in the late summer and early fall. It most often affects children and adults under age 30. Symptoms may include:HeadacheSensitivity to light (photophobia)Slight feverUpset stomach and diarrhea Fatigue Bacterial meningitis is an emergency. You will need immediate treatment in a hospital. Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include:Fever and chillsMental status changesNausea and vomitingSensitivity to lightSevere headacheStiff neck Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:AgitationBulging fontanelles in babiesDecreased alertnessPoor feeding or irritability in childrenRapid breathingUnusual posture, with the head and neck arched backward (opisthotonos) You cannot tell if you have bacterial or viral meningitis by how you feel. Your health care provider must find out the cause. Go to a hospital emergency department right away if you think you have symptoms of meningitis.Exams and Tests

Your provider will examine you. This may show:Fast heart rateFeverMental status changesStiff neck If the provider thinks you have meningitis, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) should be done to remove a sample of spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF) for testing.Other tests that may be done include:Blood cultureChest x-rayCT scan of the headTreatment

Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial meningitis. Antibiotics do not treat viral meningitis. But antiviral medicine may be given to those with herpes meningitis.Other treatments will include:Fluids through a vein (IV)Medicines to treat symptoms, such as brain swelling, shock, and seizuresOutlook (Prognosis)

Early diagnosis and treatment of bacterial meningitis is essential to prevent permanent neurological damage. Viral meningitis is usually not serious, and symptoms should disappear within 2 weeks with no lasting complications.Possible Complications

Without prompt treatment, meningitis may result in the following: Brain or neurologic damageBuildup of fluid between the skull and brain (subdural effusion)Hearing lossBuildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus)SeizuresDeathWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

If you think that you or your child has symptoms of meningitis, get emergency medical help immediately. Early treatment is key to a good outcome.Prevention

Certain vaccines can help prevent some types of bacterial meningitis: Haemophilus vaccine (HiB vaccine) given to children helps.Pneumococcal vaccine is given to children and adults.Meningococcal vaccine is given to children and adults; some communities hold vaccination campaigns after an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis. Household members and others in close contact with people who have meningococcal meningitis should receive antibiotics to prevent becoming infected.Alternative Names

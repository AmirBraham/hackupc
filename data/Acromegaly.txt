 Acromegaly is a condition in which there is too much growth hormone (GH) in your body.Causes

Acromegaly is a rare condition. It is caused when the pituitary gland makes too much GH. The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland attached to the bottom of the brain. It controls, makes, and releases several hormones, including GH.Usually, a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland releases too much GH. In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be inherited.In children, too much GH causes gigantism rather than acromegaly.Symptoms

Symptoms of acromegaly may include any of the following:Body odorBlood in the stoolCarpal tunnel syndromeDecreased muscle strength (weakness)Decreased peripheral visionDental problems, gaps between the teethEasy fatigueEnlarged tongueExcessive height (when excessÂ GH production begins in childhood)Excessive sweatingHeadacheHeart enlargement, which can cause fainting or shortness of breathHoarsenessJaw painJoint pain, limited joint movement, swelling of the bony areas around a jointLarge bones of the face, large jaw and tongue, widely spaced teethLarge feet (change in shoe size), large hands (change in ring or glove size)Large glands in the skin (sebaceous glands) causing oily skin, thickening of the skin, skin tags (growths)Sleep apneaWidened fingers or toes, with swelling, redness, and pain Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:Colon polypsExcess hair growth in females (hirsutism)High blood pressureType 2 diabetesThyroid enlargementWeight gainExams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.The following tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of acromegaly and check for complications:Blood glucoseGrowth hormoneInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)ProlactinSpine x-rayMRI of the brain, including the pituitary glandEchocardiogramColonoscopySleep studyOther tests may be ordered to check whether the rest of the pituitary gland is working normally.Often a GH suppression test is needed. This involves drawing blood from a vein 4 or 5 times over 2 hours before and after drinking a specific amount of a sugar solution. Glucose and GH are measured in the blood.Treatment

Surgery to remove the pituitary tumor that is causing this condition often corrects the abnormal GH. Sometimes, the tumor is too large to be removed completely and acromegaly is not cured. In this case, medicines and radiation (radiotherapy) may be used to treat acromegaly.Some people with tumors that are too complicated to remove by surgery are treated with medicines instead of surgery. These medicines may block the production of GH from the pituitary gland or prevent the action of GH in other parts of the body.After treatment, you will need to see your provider regularly to make sure that the pituitary gland is working normally and that acromegaly does not come back. Yearly evaluations are usually recommended.Support Groups

More information and support for people with acromegaly and their families can be found at:National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/acromegalyNational Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/acromegaly/Outlook (Prognosis)

Pituitary surgery is successful in most people, depending on the size of the tumor and the experience of the neurosurgeon with pituitary tumors.Without treatment, the symptoms will get worse. Conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease may result.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if: You have symptoms of acromegalyYour symptoms do not improve with treatmentPrevention

Acromegaly cannot be prevented. Early treatment may prevent the disease from getting worse and help to avoid complications.Alternative Names

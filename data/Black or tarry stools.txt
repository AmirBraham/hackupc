 Black or tarry stools with a foul smell are a sign of a problem in the upper digestive tract. It most often indicates that there is bleeding in the stomach, small intestine, or right side of the colon.The term melena is used to describe this finding.Considerations

Eating black licorice, blueberries, blood sausage or taking iron pills, activated charcoal, or medicines that contain bismuth (such as Pepto-Bismol), can also cause black stools. Beets and foods with red coloring can sometimes make stools appear reddish. In all these cases, your doctor can test the stool with a chemical to rule out the presence of blood.Bleeding in the esophagus or stomach (such as with peptic ulcer disease) can also cause you to vomit blood.Causes

The color of the blood in the stools can indicate the source of bleeding.
Black or tarry stools may be due to bleeding in the upper part of the GI (gastrointestinal) tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, or the first part of the small intestine. In this case, blood is darker because it gets digested on its way through the GI tract.Red or fresh blood in the stools (rectal bleeding), is a sign of bleeding from the lower GI tract (rectum and anus).Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of acute upper GI bleeding. Black and tarry stools may also occur due to:Abnormal blood vessels in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenumA tear in the esophagus from violent vomiting (Mallory-Weiss tear)Blood supply being cut off to part of the intestinesInflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis)Trauma or foreign bodyWidened, overgrown veins (called varices) in the esophagus and stomach, commonly caused by liver cirrhosisCancer of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or ampulla of VaterWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

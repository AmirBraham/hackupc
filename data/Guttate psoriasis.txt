Guttate psoriasis is a type of psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis is usually seen in people younger than 30, especially in children. The condition often develops suddenly. It usually appears after an infection, most notably strep throat caused by group A streptococcus. Guttate psoriasis is not contagious. This means it can't spread to other people.Psoriasis is a common disorder. The exact cause isn't known. But doctors think genes and the immune system are involved. Certain things can trigger an attack of symptoms.With guttate psoriasis, in addition to strep throat, the following may trigger an attack:Bacteria or viral infections, including upper respiratory infectionsInjury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bitesSome medicines, including those used to treat malaria and certain heart conditionsStressSunburnToo much alcohol Psoriasis may be severe in people who have a weakened immune system. This may include people who have:HIV/AIDSAutoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritisChemotherapy for cancer Symptoms

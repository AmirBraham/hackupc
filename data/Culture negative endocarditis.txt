 Culture-negative endocarditis is an infection and inflammation of the lining of one or more heart valves, but in which no endocarditis-causing germs can be found in a routineÂ blood culture. This is because certain germs do not grow well in a laboratory setting, or some people have received antibiotics in the past that keep such germs from growing outside of the body.Endocarditis is usually a result of a bloodstream infection. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream during certain medical procedures, including dental procedures or through intravenous injection using non-sterile needles. Then bacteria can travel to the heart, where they can settle on heart valves.Alternative Names

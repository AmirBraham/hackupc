 Cryptococcal meningitis is a fungal infection of the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord. These tissues are called meninges.Causes

In most cases, cryptococcal meningitis is caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. This fungus is found in soil around the world. Cryptococcus gattii can also cause meningitis, but this form can cause disease in patients with a normal immune system as well.This type of meningitis is not spread from person to person. Usually, it spreads through the bloodstream to the brain from another place in the body that has the infection. Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis most often affects people with a weakened immune system, including people with:AIDSCirrhosis (a type of liver disease)DiabetesLeukemiaLymphomaSarcoidosisAn organ transplant The disease is rare in people who have a normal immune system and no long-term health problems.Symptoms

This form of meningitis starts slowly, over a few days to a few weeks. Symptoms may include:FeverHallucinationsHeadacheMental status change (confusion)Nausea and vomitingSensitivity to lightStiff neck Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms.A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is used to diagnose meningitis. In this test, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed from your spine and tested.Other tests that may be done include:Blood cultureChest x-rayCryptococcal antigen in CSF or bloodCSF examination for cell count, glucose, and proteinCT scan of the headGram stain, other special stains, and culture of CSFTreatment

Antifungal medicines are used to treat this form of meningitis. Intravenous (IV, through a vein) therapy with amphotericin B is the most common treatment. It is often combined with an oral antifungal medicine called 5-flucytosine.Another oral drug, fluconazole, in high doses may also be effective. If needed, it will be prescribed later in the disease course.Outlook (Prognosis)

People who recover from cryptococcal meningitis need long-term medicine to prevent the infection from coming back. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, will also need long-term treatment to improve their immune system.Possible Complications

These complications may occur from this infection:Brain damageHearing or vision lossHydrocephalusÂ (excessive CSF in the brain)SeizuresDeath Amphotericin B can have side effects such as:Nausea and vomitingFever and chillsJoint and muscles achesKidney damage When to Contact a Medical Professional

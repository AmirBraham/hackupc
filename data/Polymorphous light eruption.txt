 Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) is a common skin reaction in people who are sensitive to sunlight (ultraviolet light).Causes

The exact cause of PMLE is unknown. However, it may be genetic. Health care providers think it is a type of delayed allergic reaction. It is common among young women who live in moderate (temperate) climates.Symptoms

Polymorphous means taking on different forms, and eruption means rash. As the name suggests, symptoms of PMLE are rash-like and are different in different people. PMLE most often occurs in spring and early summer on areas of the body exposed to the sun.Symptoms usually appear within 1 to 4 days after exposure to sunlight. They include any of the following:Small bumps (papules) or blistersRedness or scaling of the skinItching or burning of the affected skinSwelling, or even blisters (not often seen)Exams and Tests

Your provider will examine your skin. Usually, your provider can diagnose PMLE based on your description of the symptoms.Tests that may be done include:Phototesting, during which your skin is exposed to special ultraviolet light to check if your skin develops a rashRemoving a small amount of skin for examination skin biopsy to rule out other diseasesTreatment

Steroid creams or ointments containing vitamin D may be prescribed by your provider. They are used 2 or 3 times a day at the start of the eruption. Steroid or other types of pills may be used for more severe cases.Phototherapy may also be prescribed.

 Purpura is purple-colored spots and patches that occur on the skin, and in mucus membranes, including the lining of the mouth.Considerations

Purpura occurs when small blood vessels leak blood under the skin.Purpura measure between 4 and 10 mm (millimeters) in diameter. When purpura spots are less than 4 mm in diameter, they are called petechiae. Purpura spots larger than 1 cm (centimeter) are called ecchymoses.Platelets help the blood clot. A person with purpura may have a normal platelet count (non-thrombocytopenic purpuras) or a low platelet counts (thrombocytopenic purpuras).Causes

Non-thrombocytopenic purpuras may be due to:Amyloidosis (disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs)Blood clotting disordersCongenital cytomegalovirus (condition in which an infant is infected with a virus called cytomegalovirus before birth)Congenital rubella syndromeDrugs that affect platelet function or clotting factorsFragile blood vessels seen in older people (senile purpura)Hemangioma (abnormal buildup of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs)Inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis), such as Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura, which causes a raised type of purpuraPressure changes that occur during vaginal childbirthScurvy (vitamin C deficiency)Steroid useCertain infectionsInjury Thrombocytopenic purpura may be due to:Drugs that reduce the platelet countIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) -- a bleeding disorderImmune neonatal thrombocytopenia (can occur in infants whose mothers have ITP)Meningococcemia (bloodstream infection) When to Contact a Medical Professional

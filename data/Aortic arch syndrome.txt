 The aortic arch is the top part of the main artery carrying blood away from the heart. Aortic arch syndrome refers to a group of signs and symptoms associated with structural problems in the arteries that branch off the aortic arch.Watch this video about:HeartbeatCauses

Aortic arch syndrome problems can be due to trauma, blood clots, or malformations that develop before birth. These defects result in abnormal blood flow to the head, neck, or arms.In children, there are many types of aortic arch syndromes, including:Congenital absence of a branch of the aortaIsolation of the subclavian arteriesVascular ringsAn inflammatory disease called Takayasu syndrome may result in narrowing (stenosis) of the vessels of the aortic arch. This typically occurs in women and girls. This disease is seen more often in people of Asian descent.Symptoms

Symptoms vary according to which artery or other structure that has been affected. Symptoms may include:Blood pressure changesBreathing problemsDizziness, blurred vision, weakness, and other brain and nervous system (neurological) changesNumbness of an armReduced pulseSwallowing problemsTransient ischemic attacks (TIA)Treatment

Surgery is often needed to treat the underlying cause of aortic arch syndrome.Alternative Names

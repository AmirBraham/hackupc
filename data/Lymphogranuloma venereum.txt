 Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI).Causes

LGV is a long-term (chronic) infection of the lymphatic system. It is caused by certain strains of the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. The bacteria are spread by sexual contact. The infection is not caused by the same strain of bacteria that causes genital chlamydia.LGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America. LGV is more common in men than women. The main risk factor is being HIV-positive.Symptoms

 Cellulitis is a common skin infection caused by bacteria. It affects the middle layer of the skin (dermis) and the tissues below. Sometimes, muscle below the skin can be affected.Causes

Staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are the most common causes of cellulitis.Normal skin has many types of bacteria living on it. When there is a break in the skin, these bacteria can cause a skin infection.Risk factors for cellulitis include:Cracks or peeling skin between the toesHistory of peripheral vascular diseaseInjury or trauma with a break in the skin (skin wounds)Insect bites and stings, animal bites, or human bitesUlcers from certain diseases, including diabetes and vascular diseaseUse of corticosteroid medicines or other medicines that suppress the immune systemWound from a recent surgery Symptoms

Symptoms of cellulitis include:Fever with chills and sweatingFatiguePain or tenderness in the affected areaSkin redness or inflammation that gets bigger as the infection spreadsSkin sore or rash that starts suddenly, and grows quickly in the first 24 hoursTight, glossy, stretched appearance of the skinWarm skin in the area of rednessMuscle aches and joint stiffness from swelling of the tissue over the jointNausea and vomitingExams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal:Redness, warmth, tenderness, and swelling of the skinPossible drainage, if there is a buildup of pus (abscess) with the skin infectionSwollen glands (lymph nodes) near the affected area Your provider may mark the edges of the redness with a pen, to see if the redness goes past the marked border over the next several days.Tests that may be ordered include:Blood cultureComplete blood count (CBC)Culture of any fluid or material inside the affected areaA biopsy may be done if other conditions are suspected Treatment

You will likely be prescribed antibiotics to be taken by mouth. You may be given pain medicine as well, if needed.At home, raise the infected area higher than your heart to reduce swelling and speed up healing. Rest until your symptoms improve.You may need to stay in a hospital if:You are very sick (for example, you have a very high temperature, low blood pressure, or nausea and vomiting that does not go away)You have been on antibiotics and the infection is getting worse (spreading beyond the original pen marking)Your immune system is not working well (due to cancer, HIV, or other medical condition)You have an infection around your eyesYou require antibiotics through a vein (IV) Outlook (Prognosis)

Cellulitis usually goes away after taking antibiotics for 7Â to 10 days. Longer treatment may be needed if cellulitis is more severe. This may occur if you have a chronic disease or your immune system is not working properly.People with fungal infections of the feet may have cellulitis that keeps coming back, especially if you have diabetes. Cracks in the skin from the fungal infection allow the bacteria to get into the skin.Possible Complications

The following may result if cellulitis isn't treated or treatment doesn't work:Blood infection (sepsis)Bone infection (osteomyelitis)Inflammation of the lymph vessels (lymphangitis)Inflammation of the heart (endocarditis)Infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)ShockTissue death (gangrene) When to Contact a Medical Professional

PLAN TO GET PLENTY OF NUTRIENTSIf you follow a vegetarian diet, you need to make sure you get proper nutrition. You need to eat a variety of foods to get all the calories and nutrients needed for growth and good health. Certain groups of people may need to plan carefully, such as:Young children and teensPregnant or breastfeeding womenOlder adultsPeople with cancer and some chronic illnesses Vegetarian diets that include some dairy products and eggs have all the nutrition you need. But the more restrictive your diet, the harder it can be to get certain nutrients.If you choose to avoid most or all animal foods, pay close attention to make sure you get all of the following nutrients.Vitamin B12: You need this vitamin to help prevent anemia. Eggs and dairy foods have the most B12, so vegans may have a hard time getting enough. You can get B12 from these foods:EggsMilk, yogurt, low-fat cheese, cottage cheese, and other dairy productsFoods that have B12 added to them (fortified), such as cereal and soy productsNutritional yeastSeafood such as clams, salmon, and tuna (this only applies to pescetarians and semi-vegetarians) Vitamin D: You need this vitamin for bone health. You can get vitamin D from sun exposure. But you should limit sun exposure due to skin cancer concerns. Depending on where you live and other factors, you most likely will not be able to get enough from sun exposure. You can get vitamin D from these foods:Fatty fish, such as sardines, salmon, and mackerel (this only applies to pescetarians and semi-vegetarians)Egg yolksFoods that are fortified with vitamin D, such as orange juice, cow's milk, soy milk, rice milk, and cereals Zinc: Zinc is important for the immune system and cell growth, especially in teens. Your body does not absorb zinc from plant foods as well as from meat and other animal foods. You can get zinc from these foods:Beans and legumes, such as chickpeas, kidney beans, and baked beansNuts and seeds, such as almonds, peanuts, and cashewsSeafood, such as oysters, crab, and lobster (this only applies to pescetarians and semi-vegetarians)Yogurt and cheeseFoods fortified with zinc, such as milk and cereals Iron: You need iron for your red blood cells. Your body does not absorb the type of iron found from plant foods as well as from the type found in meat and other animal foods. You can get iron from these foods:Beans and legumes, such as white beans, lentils, and kidney beansGreen vegetables, such as broccoli, spinach, kale, and collard greensDried fruit, such as prunes, raisins, and apricotsWhole grainsFoods fortified with iron, such as cereals and breads Eating foods that are high in vitamin C at the same meal as iron-rich foods increase iron absorption. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Foods high in vitamin C include, tomatoes, potatoes, citrus fruits, bell peppers, and strawberries.Calcium: Foods high in calcium help keep bones strong. Dairy products have the highest amount of calcium. If you do not eat dairy, it can be hard to get enough. Oxalates, a substance found in plant foods inhibits calcium absorption. Foods that are high in both oxalates and calcium are not good sources of calcium. Examples include, spinach, Swiss chard, and beet greens.You can get calcium from these foods:Sardines and canned salmon with bones (this only applies to pescetarians and semi-vegetarians)Dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and cheeseGreen vegetables, such as collard greens, kale, bok choy, and broccoliOranges and figsTofuAlmonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and white beansFoods fortified with calcium, such as cereal, orange juice, and soy, almond and rice milk Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3s may be important for your heart and brain health. You can get omega-3s from these foods:Fatty fish, such as halibut, mackerel, salmon, herring, and sardines (this only applies to pescetarians and semi-vegetarians)Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, ground flaxseed, canola oil, chia seedsSoybeans and soy oilFoods fortified with omega-3s, such as bread, eggs, juice, and milk Protein: It is easy to get plenty of protein even if you do not eat any animal products. If you eat fish and/or eggs and dairy getting enough protein will not be a concern for most people. You can also get protein from these foods:Soy foods, such as soy nuts, soy milk, tempeh and tofu.Seitan (made of gluten).Vegetarian meat substitutes. Just watch for products that are high in sodium.Legumes, beans, and lentils.Nuts, nut butters, seeds, and whole grains.Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese. You do not need to combine these foods at the same meal to get enough protein.Teens and pregnant women should work with a registered dietitian to make sure they are getting enough protein and other key nutrients.Recommendations

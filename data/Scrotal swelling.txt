 Scrotal swelling is abnormal enlargement of the scrotum. This is the name for the sac surrounding the testicles.Considerations

Scrotal swelling can occur in males at any age. The swelling can be on one or both sides, and there may be pain. The testicles and penis may or may not be involved.In testicular torsion, the testicle becomes twisted in the scrotum and loses its blood supply. It is a serious emergency. If this twisting is not relieved quickly, the testicle may be permanently and completely damaged. This condition is extremely painful. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or see your health care provider immediately. Losing blood supply for just a few hours can cause tissue death and the loss of a testicle.Causes

Can you feel tissue in the swollen area?Is the swelling in just one part of the scrotum or in the entire scrotum?Is the swelling the same on both sides (sometimes a swollen scrotum is actually an enlarged testicle, a testicular lump, or a swollen duct)?Have you had surgery, injury, or trauma in the genital area?Have you had a recent genital infection?Does the swelling go down after you rest in bed?Do you have any other symptoms?Is there any pain in the area around the scrotum?The physical exam will include a detailed exam of the scrotum, testicles, and penis.

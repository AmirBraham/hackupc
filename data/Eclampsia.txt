 Eclampsia is the new onset of seizures or coma in a pregnant woman with preeclampsia. These seizures are not related to an existing brain condition.Causes

The exact cause of eclampsia is not known. Factors that may play a role include:Blood vessel problemsBrain and nervous system (neurological) factorsDietGenes Eclampsia follows a condition called preeclampsia. This is a complication of pregnancy in which a woman has high blood pressure and other findings. Most women with preeclampsia do not go on to have seizures. It is hard to predict which women will. Women at high risk of seizures often have severe preeclampsia with findings such as:Abnormal blood testsHeadachesVery high blood pressureVision changesAbdominal pain Your chances of getting preeclampsia increase when:You are 35 or older.You are African American.This is your first pregnancy.You have diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease.You are having more than 1 baby (such as twins or triplets).You are a teen. You are obese.You have a family history of preeclampsia.You have autoimmune disorders.You have undergone in vitro fertilization.Symptoms

Symptoms of eclampsia include:SeizuresSevere agitationUnconsciousness Most women will have these symptoms of preeclampsia before the seizure:HeadachesNausea and vomitingStomach painSwelling of the hands and faceVision problems, such as loss of vision, blurred vision, double vision, or missing areas in the visual field Exams and Tests

The health care provider will do a physical exam to look for causes of seizures. Your blood pressure and breathing rate will be checked regularly.Blood and urine tests may be done to check:Blood clotting factorsCreatinineHematocritUric acidLiver functionPlatelet countProtein in the urine Hemoglobin levelTreatment

The main treatment to prevent severe preeclampsia from progressing to eclampsia is giving birth to the baby. Letting the pregnancy go on can be dangerous for you and the baby.You may be given medicine to prevent seizures. These medicines are called anticonvulsants. Your provider may give medicine to lower high blood pressure. If your blood pressure stays high, delivery may be needed, even if it is before the baby is due.Possible Complications

Women with eclampsia or preeclampsia have a higher risk for: Separation of the placenta (placenta abruptio)Premature delivery that leads to complications in the babyBlood clotting problemsStrokeInfant deathWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Emergency symptoms include seizures or decreased alertness.Seek medical care right away if you have any of the following:Bright red vaginal bleedingLittle or no movement in the babySevere headacheSevere pain in the upper right abdominal areaVision lossNausea or vomiting Prevention

Getting medical care during your entire pregnancy is important in preventing complications. This allows problems such as preeclampsia to be detected and treated early. Getting treatment for preeclampsia may prevent eclampsia.Alternative Names

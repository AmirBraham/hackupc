 Hepatic vein obstruction is a blockage of the hepatic vein, which carries blood away from the liver.Causes

Hepatic vein obstruction prevents blood from flowing out of the liver and back to the heart. This blockage can cause liver damage. Obstruction of this vein can be caused by a tumor or growth pressing on the vessel, or by a clot in the vessel (hepatic vein thrombosis).Most often, it is caused by conditions that make blood clots more likely to form, including:Abnormal growth of cells in the bone marrow (myeloproliferative disorders)CancersChronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseasesInfectionsInherited (hereditary) or acquired problems with blood clottingOral contraceptivesPregnancyHepatic vein blockage is the most common cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome.Symptoms

   Blood thinners (anticoagulants)

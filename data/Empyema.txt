 Empyema is a collection of pus in the space between the lung and the inner surface of the chest wall (pleural space).Causes

Empyema is usually caused by an infection that spreads directly from the lung. It leads to a buildup of pus in the pleural space.There can be 2 cups (1/2 liter) or more of infected fluid. This fluid puts pressure on the lungs.Risk factors include:Bacterial pneumoniaTuberculosisChest surgeryLung abscessTrauma or injury to the chest In rare cases, empyema can occur after thoracentesis. This is a procedure in which a needle is inserted through the chest wall to remove fluid in the pleural space for medical diagnosis or treatment.Symptoms

Symptoms of empyema may include any of the following:Chest pain, which worsens when you breathe in deeply (pleurisy)Dry coughExcessive sweating, especially night sweatsFever and chillsGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)Shortness of breathWeight loss (unintentional) Exams and Tests

Your health care provider may note decreased breath sounds or an abnormal sound (friction rub) when listening to your chest with a stethoscope (auscultation).Tests that may be ordered include:Chest x-ray (may require multiple positions)CT scan of chestThoracentesisPleural fluid analysisTreatment

The goal of treatment is to cure the infection. This involves the following:Placing a tube in your chest to drain the pusGiving you antibiotics to control the infectionIf you have problems breathing, you may need surgery to help your lung expand properly.Outlook (Prognosis)

When empyema complicates pneumonia, the risk for permanent lung damage and death goes up. Long-term treatment with antibiotics and drainage are needed. In general, most people fully recover from empyema.Possible Complications

Having empyema may lead to the following:Pleural thickeningReduced lung functionWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

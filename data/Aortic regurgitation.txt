 Aortic regurgitation is a heart valve disease in which the aortic valve does not close tightly. This allows blood to flow from the aorta (the largest blood vessel) into the left ventricle (a chamber of the heart).Causes

Any condition that prevents the aortic valve from closing completely can cause this problem. When the valve does not close all the way, some blood comes back each time the heart beats. When a large amount of blood comes back, the heart must work harder to force out enough blood to meet the body's needs. The left lower chamber of the heart widens (dilates) and the heart beats very strongly (bounding pulse). Over time, the heart becomes less able to supply enough blood to the body.In the past, rheumatic fever was the main cause of aortic regurgitation. The use of antibiotics to treat strep infections has made rheumatic fever less common. Therefore, aortic regurgitation is more commonly due to other causes. These include:Ankylosing spondylitisAortic dissectionCongenital (present at birth) valve problems, such as bicuspid valveEndocarditis (infection of the heart valves)High blood pressureMarfan syndromeReiter syndrome (also known as reactive arthritis)SyphilisSystemic lupus erythematosusTrauma to the chest Aortic insufficiency is most common in men between the ages of 30 and 60.Symptoms

The condition often has no symptoms for many years. Symptoms may come on slowly or suddenly. They may include: Bounding pulseChest pain similar to angina (rare)FaintingFatiguePalpitations (sensation of the heart beating)Shortness of breath with activity or when lying downWaking up short of breath some time after falling asleepSwelling of the feet, legs, or abdomenUneven, rapid, racing, pounding, or fluttering pulseWeakness that is more likely to occur with activity Exams and Tests

Signs may include:Heart murmur that can be heard through a stethoscopeVery forceful beating of the heartBobbing of the head in time with the heartbeatHard pulses in the arms and legsLow diastolic blood pressureSigns of fluid in the lungs Aortic regurgitation may be seen on tests such as:Aortic angiographyEchocardiogram -- ultrasound examination of the heartLeft heart catheterizationMRI or CT scan of the heartTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) A chest x-ray may show swelling of the left lower heart chamber.Lab tests cannot diagnose aortic insufficiency. However, they may help rule out other causes.Treatment

You may not need treatment if you have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. However, you will need to see a health care provider for regular echocardiograms. If your blood pressure is high, you may need to take blood pressure medicines to help slow the worsening of aortic regurgitation.Diuretics (water pills) may be prescribed for symptoms of heart failure.In the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or an invasive procedure, such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often. You may need to limit activity that requires more work from your heart. Talk to your provider.Surgery to repair or replace the aortic valve corrects aortic regurgitation. The decision to have aortic valve replacement depends on your symptoms and the condition and function of your heart. There is increasing interest in a minimally invasive procedure in which a replacement valve is implanted via catheter. This is similar to a procedure traditionally done in people with aortic stenosis. This option may become more common in the future.You may also need surgery to repair the aorta if it is enlarged.Outlook (Prognosis)

Surgery can cure aortic insufficiency and relieve symptoms, unless you develop heart failure or other complications. People with angina or congestive heart failure due to aortic regurgitation do poorly without treatment.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Abnormal heart rhythmsHeart failureInfection in the heartWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if:You have symptoms of aortic regurgitation.You have aortic insufficiency and your symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop (especially chest pain, difficulty breathing, or swelling). Prevention

Blood pressure control is very important if you are at risk for aortic regurgitation.Alternative Names

 Biofeedback is a technique that measures bodily functions and gives you information about them in order to help train you to control them.Information

Biofeedback is most often based on measurements of:Blood pressureBrain waves (EEG)BreathingHeart rateMuscle tensionSkin conductivity of electricitySkin temperatureBy watching these measurements, you can learn how to change these functions by relaxing or by holding pleasant images in your mind.Patches, called electrodes, are placed on different parts of your body. They measure your heart rate, blood pressure, or other function. A monitor displays the results. A tone or other sound may be used to let you know when you have reached a goal or certain state.Your health care provider will describe a situation and guide you through relaxation techniques. The monitor lets you see how your heart rate and blood pressure change in response to being stressed or remaining relaxed.Biofeedback teaches you how to control and change these bodily functions. By doing so, you feel more relaxed or more able to cause specific muscle relaxation processes. This may help treat conditions such as:Anxiety and insomniaConstipationTension and migraine headachesUrinary incontinencePain disorders such as headache or fibromyalgiaAlcoholism and other substance use disordersImages

 Small intestine aspirate and culture is a lab test to check for infection in the small intestine.How the Test is Performed

A sample of fluid from the small intestine is needed. A procedure called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is done to get the sample.The fluid is placed in a special dish in the laboratory. It is watched for growth of bacteria or other organisms. This is called a culture.How the Test will Feel

You are not involved in the test once the sample is taken.Why the Test is Performed

Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs of too much bacteria growing in the intestinal tract. In most cases, other tests are done first. This test is rarely done outside of a research setting. In most cases, it has been replaced by a breath test that checks for excess bacteria in the small bowel.Normally, small amounts of bacteria are present in the small intestine and they do not cause disease. However, the test may be done when your doctor suspects that excess growth of intestinal bacteria is causing diarrhea.Normal Results

No bacteria should be found.Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be a sign of infection.Risks

There are no risks associated with a laboratory culture. The risks of the EGD procedure include:BleedingPerforation of (poking a hole in) the gastrointestinal tract by the scopeInfectionSome people may not be able to have this test because of other medical conditions.Images

 Language disorders in children are problems with the development of language skills.Children may have problems with one or both of the following:Getting their meaning or message across to others (expressive language disorder)Understanding the message coming from others (receptive language disorder) Children with language disorders are able to produce sounds, and their speech can be understood.Causes

Most infants and children develop language naturally starting at birth. To develop language, a child must be able to hear, see, understand, and remember. Children must also be physically able to form speech.Up to 1 of every 20 children has symptoms of a language disorder. When the cause is unknown, it is called a developmental language disorder.Problems with receptive language skills usually begin before age 4. Some mixed language disorders are caused by a brain injury. These conditions are sometimes misdiagnosed as developmental disorders.Language disorders may occur in children with:Other developmental problemsAutism spectrum disorderHearing lossLearning disabilitiesDamage to the central nervous system, which is called aphasiaLanguage disorders are rarely caused by a lack of intelligence.Language disorders are not the same as delayed language. With delayed language, the child develops speech and language in the same way as other children, but later. In language disorders, speech and language do not develop normally. The child may have some language skills, but not others. Or, the way in which these skills develop will be different than usual.Symptoms

Children with language disorders may have one, two, or many of the symptoms listed below. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.Children with a receptive language disorder have problems understanding language. They may have:A hard time understanding what other people have saidProblems following directions that are spoken to themProblems organizing their thoughtsChildren with an expressive language disorder have problems using language to express what they are thinking or need. These children may:Have a hard time putting words together into sentencesUse short and simple sentences and the word order may be offHave difficulty finding the right words when talking, and often use placeholder words such as "um"Have a vocabulary that is below the level of other children the same ageLeave words out of sentences when talkingUse certain phrases over and over again, and repeat (echo) parts or all of questionsUse tenses (past, present, future) improperlyChildren with language problems may have difficulty in social settings. At times, language disorders may be part of the cause of severe behavioral problems.Exams and Tests

A medical history may reveal that the child has close relatives who have also had speech and language problems.Any child suspected of having this disorder can have standardized receptive and expressive language tests. A speech and language therapist or neuropsychologist will administer these tests.A hearing test called audiometry should also be done to rule out hearing impairment, which is one of the most common causes of language problems.Treatment

Speech and language therapy is the best approach to treating this type of language disorder.Counseling, such as talk therapy, is also recommended because of the possibility of related emotional or behavioral problems.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome varies, based on the cause.Â Children with brain injury or other structural problems may have long-term problems with language. Other, more reversible causes can be treated effectively.Many children who have language problems during the preschool years will also have some language problems or learning difficulty later in childhood. They may also have reading disorders.Possible Complications

Difficulty understanding and using language can cause problems with social interaction and the ability to function independently as an adult.Reading may be a problem.Depression, anxiety, and other emotional or behavioral problems may complicate language disorders.When to Contact a Medical Professional

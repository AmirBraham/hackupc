It usually includes:Delusions: False beliefs about what is taking place or who one isHallucinations: Seeing or hearing things that aren't there The types of delusions and hallucinations are often related to your depressed feelings.

The person may develop false beliefs about their body, such as believing that they have cancer.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms. Your answers and certain questionnaires can help your provider diagnose this condition and determine how severe it may be.Blood and urine tests, and possibly a brain scan may be done to rule out other medical conditions with similar symptoms.Treatment

Psychotic depression requires immediate medical care and treatment. Treatment usually involves antidepressant and antipsychotic medicine. You may only need antipsychotic medicine for a short period of time.Electroconvulsive therapy can help treat depression with psychotic symptoms.

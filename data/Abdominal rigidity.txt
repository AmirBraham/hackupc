 Abdominal rigidity is stiffness of the muscles in the belly area, which can be felt when touched or pressed.Considerations

When there is a sore area inside the belly or abdomen, the pain will often get worse when a hand presses against your belly area.Your fear or nervousness about being touched (palpated) may cause your abdominal muscles to stiffen, but there should be no pain.If you have pain when you are touched and you tighten the muscles to guard against more pain, it is more likely caused by a physical condition inside your body. The condition may affect one or both sides of your body.Abdominal rigidity may occur with:Abdominal tendernessNauseaPainSwellingVomitingCauses

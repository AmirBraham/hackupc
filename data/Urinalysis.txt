 Urinalysis is the physical, chemical, and microscopic examination of urine. It involves a number of tests to detect and measure various compounds that pass through the urine.How the Test is Performed

A urine sample is needed. Your health care provider will tell you what type of urine sample is needed. Two common methods of collecting urine are 24-hour urine collection and clean catch urine specimen. The sample is sent to a lab, where it is examined for the following:PHYSICAL COLOR AND APPEARANCEHow the urine sample looks to the naked eye:Is it clear or cloudy?Is it pale, or dark yellow, or another color? MICROSCOPIC APPEARANCEThe urine sample is examined under a microscope to:Check if there are any cells, urine crystals, urinary casts, mucus, and other substances.Identify any bacteria or other germs. CHEMICAL TESTS (urine chemistry)A special strip (dipstick) is used to test for substances in the urine sample. The strip has pads of chemicals that change color when they come in contact with substances of interest. Examples of specific urinalysis tests that may be done to check for problems include:Red blood cell urine testGlucose urine testProtein urine testUrine pH level testKetones urine testBilirubin urine testUrine specific gravity testHow to Prepare for the Test

Certain medicines change the color of urine, but this is not a sign of disease. Your provider may tell you to stop taking any medicines that can affect test results.Medicines that can change your urine color include:ChloroquineIron supplementsLevodopaNitrofurantoinPhenazopyridinePhenothiazinePhenytoinRiboflavinTriamterene How the Test will Feel

The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.Why the Test is Performed

Some foods, such as beets and blackberries, may turn urine red.Usually, glucose, ketones, protein, and bilirubin are not detectable in urine. The following are not normally found in urine:HemoglobinNitritesRed blood cellsWhite blood cells Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Have this information ready:Person's age, weight, and conditionName of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)Time it was swallowedAmount swallowedPoison Control

Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.What to Expect at the Emergency Room

Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:Activated charcoalBlood and urine testsBreathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator)Chest x-rayECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)Endoscopy (camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach)Fluids through a vein (by IV)LaxativeSurgery to remove burned skin (debridement)Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days Outlook (Prognosis)

How well someone does depends on the amount of poison swallowed or otherwise exposed to and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.Skin problems will clear up when use of the product is stopped. If the lotion is swallowed, recovery normally occurs if the right treatment is received in time.Most home permanent kits that contain cold wave lotions are watered down to avoid poisoning. However, some hair salons may use stronger forms that need to be diluted before use. Exposure to this stronger cold wave lotion will cause much more damage than the ones used at home.Alternative Names

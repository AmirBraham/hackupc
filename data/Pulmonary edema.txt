 Pulmonary edema is an abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs. This buildup of fluid leads to shortness of breath.Causes

Pulmonary edema is often caused by congestive heart failure. When the heart is not able to pump efficiently, blood can back up into the veins that take blood through the lungs. As the pressure in these blood vessels increases, fluid is pushed into the air spaces (alveoli) in the lungs. This fluid reduces normal oxygen movement through the lungs. These two factors combine to cause shortness of breath.Congestive heart failure that leads to pulmonary edema may be caused by:Heart attack, or any disease of the heart that weakens or stiffens the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)Leaking or narrowed heart valves (mitral or aortic valves)Sudden, severe high blood pressure (hypertension)Pulmonary edema may also be caused by:Certain medicinesHigh altitude exposureKidney failureNarrowed arteries that bring blood to the kidneysLung damage caused by poisonous gas or severe infectionMajor injurySymptoms

Symptoms of pulmonary edema may include:Coughing up blood or bloody frothDifficulty breathing when lying down (orthopnea)Feeling of "air hunger" or "drowning" (This feeling is called "paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea" if it causes you to wake up 1 to 2 hours after falling asleep and struggle to catch your breath.)Grunting, gurgling, or wheezing sounds with breathingProblems speaking in full sentences because of shortness of breathOther symptoms may include:Anxiety or restlessnessDecrease in level of alertnessLeg or abdominal swellingPale skinSweating (excessive) Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a thorough physical exam.The provider will listen to your lungs and heart with a stethoscope to check for:Abnormal heart soundsCrackles in your lungs, called ralesIncreased heart rate (tachycardia)Rapid breathing (tachypnea)Other things that may be seen during the exam include:Leg or abdominal swellingAbnormalities of your neck veins (which can show that there is too much fluid in your body)Pale or blue skin color (pallor or cyanosis)Possible tests include:Blood chemistriesBlood oxygen levels (oximetry or arterial blood gases)Chest x-rayComplete blood count (CBC)Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to see if there are problems with the heart muscleElectrocardiogram (ECG) to look for signs of a heart attack or problems with the heart rhythmTreatment

Pulmonary edema is almost always treated in the emergency room or hospital. You may need to be in an intensive care unit (ICU).Oxygen is given through a face mask or tiny plastic tubes are placed in the nose.A breathing tube may be placed into the windpipe (trachea) so you can be connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) if you cannot breathe well on your own.The cause of edema should be identified and treated quickly. For example, if a heart attack has caused the condition, it must be treated right away.Medicines that may be used include:Diuretics that remove excess fluid from the bodyMedicines that strengthen the heart muscle, control the heartbeat, or relieve pressure on the heartOther medicines when heart failure is not the cause of the pulmonary edemaOutlook (Prognosis)

The outlook depends on the cause. The condition may get better quickly or slowly. Some people may need to use a breathing machine for a long time. If not treated, this condition can be life threatening.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have breathing problems.Prevention

Take all your medicines as directed if you have a disease that can lead to pulmonary edema or a weakened heart muscle.Following a healthy diet that is low in salt and fat, and controlling your other risk factors can reduce the risk of developing this condition.Alternative Names

These bacteria also cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) and some sexually transmitted diseases. Viral causes are herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus.Other causes include:InjurySensitivity to the chemicals used in spermicides, contraceptive jellies, or foams Sometimes the cause is unknown.Risks for urethritis include:Being a femaleBeing male, ages 20 to 35Having many sexual partnersHigh-risk sexual behavior (such as men having penetrating anal sex without a condom)History of sexually transmitted diseases Symptoms

Your sexual partner must also be treated if the condition is caused by an infection.Urethritis caused by trauma or chemical irritants is treated by avoiding the source of injury or irritation.Urethritis that does not clear up after antibiotic treatment and lasts for at least 6 weeks is called chronic urethritis. Different antibiotics may be used to treat this problem.Outlook (Prognosis)

However, urethritis can lead to long-term damage to the urethra and scar tissue called urethral stricture. It can also cause damage to other urinary organs in both men and women. In women, the infection could lead to fertility problems if it spreads to the pelvis.Possible Complications

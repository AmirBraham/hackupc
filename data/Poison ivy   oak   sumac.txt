 Poison ivy, oak, or sumac poisoning is an allergic reaction that results from touching the sap of these plants. The sap may be on the plant, in the ashes of burned plants, on an animal, or on other objects that came in contact with the plant, such as clothing, garden tools, and sports equipment.Small amounts of sap can remain under a person's fingernails for several days. It must be purposely removed with thorough cleaning.Plants in this family are strong and hard to get rid of. They are found in every state of the continental United States. These plants grow best along cool streams and lakes. They grow especially well in areas that are sunny and hot. They do not survive well above 1,500 m (5,000 feet), in deserts, or in rainforests. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.Poisonous Ingredient

One poisonous ingredient is the chemical urushiol.Where Found

The poisonous ingredient can be found in:Bruised roots, stems, flowers, leaves, fruitPollen, oil, and resin of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac Note: This list may not be all-inclusive.Symptoms

Symptoms of exposure may include:BlistersBurning skinItchingRedness of the skinSwelling In addition to the skin, symptoms can affect the eyes and mouth.The rash may be spread by touching undried sap and moving it around the skin.The oil can also stick to animal fur, which explains why people often contract the skin irritation (dermatitis) from their outdoor pets.Home Care

Carefully remove any contaminated clothing, being careful not to spread the oils from the plant.Wash the area right away with soap of any type and water. Quickly washing the area can prevent a reaction. However, it most often does not help if done more than 1 hour after touching the plant's sap. Flush the eyes out with water for at least 15 minutes. Take care to clean under the fingernails well to remove traces of toxin.Carefully wash any contaminated objects or clothing alone in hot soapy water. DO NOT let the items touch any other clothing or materials.An over-the-counter steroid cream may help relieve itching. Over the counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be used, but are of limited benefit. Make sure to read the label to determine if it is safe for you to take an antihistamine, since this type of drug may interact with other medicines you're taking.Before Calling Emergency

Life-threatening reactions may occur if the poisonous ingredients are swallowed or are breathed in (which can happen when the plants are burned).

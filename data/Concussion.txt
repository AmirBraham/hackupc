 A concussion may occur when the head hits an object, or a moving object strikes the head. A concussion is a less severe type of brain injury. It may also be called a traumatic brain injury.A concussion can affect how the brain works. The amount of brain injury and how long it will last depends on how severe the concussion is. A concussion may lead to headaches, changes in alertness, loss of consciousness, memory loss, and changes in thinking.Causes

A concussion can result from a fall, sports activities, vehicular accidents, assault, or other direct injury to the skull. A big movement of the brain (called jarring) in any direction can cause a person to lose alertness (become unconscious). How long the person stays unconscious may be a sign of how bad the concussion is.Concussions do not always lead to loss of consciousness. Most people never pass out. They may describe seeing all white, all black, or stars. A person can also have a concussion and not realize it.Watch this video about:ConcussionSymptoms

Symptoms of a milder concussion can include:Acting somewhat confused, feeling unable to concentrate, or not thinking clearlyBeing drowsy, hard to wake up, or similar changesHeadacheLoss of consciousness for a fairly short period of timeMemory loss (amnesia) of events before the injury or right afterNausea and vomitingSeeing flashing lights, light sensitivityFeeling like you have "lost time"Sleep abnormalities The following are emergency symptoms of a more severe head injury or concussion. Seek medical care right away if there are:Changes in alertness and consciousnessConfusion that does not go awaySeizuresMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the bodyPupils of the eyes that are not equal in sizeSymptoms in just one eyeUnusual eye movementsRepeated vomitingWalking or balance problemsUnconsciousness for a longer period of time or that continues (coma) Head injuries that cause a concussion often occur with injury to the neck and spine. Take special care when moving people who have had a head injury.Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. The person's nervous system will be checked. There may be changes in the person's pupil size, thinking ability, coordination, and reflexes.Tests that may be done include:Blood and urine testsEEG (brain wave test) may be needed if seizures continueHead CT (computerized tomography) scanMRI of the brain (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brainX-rays Treatment

For a mild brain injury, no treatment may be needed. But be aware that the symptoms of a brain injury can show up later. Your providers will explain what to expect, how to manage any headaches, how to treat your other symptoms, when to return to sports, school, work, and other activities, and signs or symptoms to worry about.Children will need to be watched and make activity changes.Adults also need close observation and activity changes. Both adults and children must follow the provider's instructions about when it will be possible to return to sports.You will likely need to stay in the hospital if:Emergency or more severe symptoms of head injury are presentThere is a skull fractureThere is any bleeding under your skull or in your brain Outlook (Prognosis)

Healing or recovering from a concussion takes time. It may take days to weeks, or even months. During that time you may:Be withdrawn, easily upset, or confused, or have other mood changesHave a hard time with tasks that require memory or concentrationHave mild headachesBe less tolerant of noiseBe very tiredFeel dizzyHave blurry vision at times These problems will probably recover slowly. You may want to get help from family or friends for making important decisions. In a small number of people, symptoms of the concussion do not go away. The risk for these long-term changes in the brain is higher after more than one concussion.Seizures may occur after more severe head injuries. You or your child may need to take anti-seizure medicines for a period of time.More severe traumatic brain injuries may result in many brain and nervous system problems.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if:A head injury causes changes in alertness.A person has other worrisome symptoms.Symptoms do not go away or are not improving after 2 or 3 weeks.Contact your provider right away if the following symptoms occur:Increased sleepiness or difficulty waking upStiff neckChanges in behavior or unusual behaviorChanges in speech (slurred, difficult to understand, does not make sense)Confusion or problems thinking straightDouble vision or blurred visionFeverFluid or blood leaking from the nose or earsHeadache that is getting worse, lasts a long time, or does not get better with over-the-counter pain relieversProblems walking or talkingSeizures (jerking of the arms or legs without control)Vomiting more than 3 times If symptoms do not go away or are not improving a lot after 2 or 3 weeks, talk to your provider.Prevention

The bacteria can spread to humans by:Coming in contact with infected meat or the placenta of infected animalsEating unpasteurized cheeseDrinking unpasteurized milkBrucellosis is rare in the United States. About 100 to 200 cases occur each year. Most cases are caused by the Brucella melitensis bacteria.People working in jobs where they often come in contact with animals or meat are at higher risk. This includes slaughterhouse workers, farmers, and veterinarians.Brucella is found in many countries worldwide including:EgyptIraqIranJordanSaudi ArabiaChadGreeceMexicoSymptoms

 Retroversion of the uterus occurs when a woman's uterus (womb) tilts backward rather than forward. It is commonly called a "tipped uterus."Causes

Retroversion of the uterus is common. Approximately 1 in 5 women has this condition. The problem may also occur due to weakening of the pelvic ligaments at the time of menopause.Scar tissue or adhesions in the pelvis can also hold the uterus in a retroverted position. Scarring may come from:EndometriosisInfection in uterus or tubes
  Pelvic surgery
  Symptoms

Retroversion of the uterus almost never causes any symptoms.Rarely, it may cause pain or discomfort.Exams and Tests

A pelvic exam will show the position of the uterus. However, a tipped uterus can sometimes be mistaken for a pelvic mass or a growing fibroid. A rectovaginal exam may be used to distinguish between a mass and a retroverted uterus.An ultrasound exam can accurately determine the exact position of the uterus.Treatment

Treatment is not needed most of the time. Underlying disorders, such as endometriosis or adhesions, should be treated as needed.Outlook (Prognosis)

In most cases, the condition does not cause problems.Possible Complications

In most cases, a retroverted uterus is a normal finding. However, in some cases it may be caused by endometriosis, salpingitis, or pressure from a growing tumor.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if you have ongoing pelvic pain or discomfort.Prevention

There is no way to prevent the problem. Early treatment of uterine infections or endometriosis may reduce the chances of a change in the position of the uterus.Alternative Names

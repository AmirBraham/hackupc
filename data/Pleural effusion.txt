 A pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity.Causes

The body produces pleural fluid in small amounts to lubricate the surfaces of the pleura. This is the thin tissue that lines the chest cavity and surrounds the lungs. Pleural effusion is an abnormal, excessive collection of this fluid.There are two types of pleural effusion:Transudative pleural effusion is caused by fluid leaking into the pleural space. This is from increased pressure in the blood vessels or a low blood protein count. Heart failure is the most common cause.Exudative effusion is caused by blocked blood vessels or lymph vessels, inflammation, infection, lung injury, or tumors. Risk factors for pleural effusion may include:Smoking and drinking alcohol, as these can cause heart, lung and liver disease, which can lead to pleural effusionHistory of any contact with asbestos Symptoms

Symptoms can include any of the following:Chest pain, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breathsCoughFever and chillsHiccupsRapid breathingShortness of breathSometimes there are no symptoms.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The provider will also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and tap (percuss) your chest and upper back.Chest CT scan or a chest x-ray may be enough for your provider to decide on treatment.Your provider may want to perform tests on the fluid. If so, a sample of fluid is removed with a needle inserted between the ribs. Tests on the fluid will be done to look for:InfectionCancer cellsProtein levels Cell countsAcidity of the fluid (sometimes)Blood tests that may be done include:Complete blood count (CBC), to check for signs of infection or anemiaKidney and liver function blood tests If needed, these other tests may be done:Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) to look for heart failureUltrasound of abdomen and liverUrine protein testingLung biopsy to look for cancerPassing a tube through the windpipe to check the airways for problems or cancer (bronchoscopy) Treatment

The goal of treatment is to:Remove the fluidPrevent fluid from building up againDetermine and treat the cause of the fluid buildup Removing the fluid (thoracentesis) may be done if there is a lot of fluid and it is causing chest pressure, shortness of breath, or a low oxygen level. Removing the fluid allows the lung to expand, making breathing easier.The cause of the fluid buildup must also be treated:If it is due to heart failure, you may receive diuretics (water pills) and other medicines to treat heart failure.If it is due to an infection, antibiotics will be given. Sometimes additional treatment is needed.If it is from cancer, liver disease, or kidney disease, treatment should be directed at these conditions.In people with cancer or infection, the effusion is often treated by using a chest tube to drain the fluid and treating its cause.In some cases, any of the following treatments are done:ChemotherapyPlacing medicine into the chest that prevents fluid from building up again after it is drainedLeaving a small size tube in place for a longer period to let the fluid drain and the lung expand overtimeRadiation therapySurgery Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome depends on the underlying disease.Possible Complications

Complications of pleural effusion may include:Lung damageInfection that turns into an abscess, called an empyemaAir in the chest cavity (pneumothorax) after drainage of the effusionPleural thickening (scarring of the lining of the lung)When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider or go to the emergency room if you have:Symptoms of pleural effusionShortness of breath or difficulty breathing right after thoracentesisAlternative Names

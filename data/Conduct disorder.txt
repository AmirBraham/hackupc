 Conduct disorder is a set of ongoing emotional and behavioral problems that occurs in children and teens. Problems may involve defiant or impulsive behavior, drug use, or criminal activity.Causes

Conduct disorder has been linked to:Child abuseDrug or alcohol use in the parentsFamily conflictsGene disordersPovertyThe diagnosis is more common among boys.It is hard to know how many children have the disorder. This is because many of the qualities for diagnosis, such as "defiance" and "rule breaking," are hard to define. For a diagnosis of conduct disorder, the behavior must be much more extreme than is socially acceptable.Conduct disorder is often linked to attention-deficit disorder. Conduct disorder also can be an early sign of depression or bipolar disorder.Symptoms

Children with conduct disorder tend to be impulsive, hard to control, and not concerned about the feelings of other people.Symptoms may include:Breaking rules without clear reasonCruel or aggressive behavior toward people or animals (for example: bullying, fighting, using dangerous weapons, forcing sexual activity, and stealing)Not going to school (truancy, beginning before age 13)Heavy drinking or drug useIntentionally setting firesLying to get a favor or avoid things they have to doRunning awayVandalizing or destroying propertyThese children often make no effort to hide their aggressive behaviors. They may have a hard time making real friends.Exams and Tests

There is no real test for diagnosing conduct disorder. The diagnosis is made when a child or teen has a history of conduct disorder behaviors.A physical examination and blood tests can help rule out medical conditions that are similar to conduct disorder. In rare cases, a brain scan helps check for other disorders.Treatment

For treatment to be successful, it must be started early. The child's family also needs to be involved. Parents can learn techniques to help manage their child's problem behavior. In cases of abuse, the child may need to be removed from the family and placed in a less chaotic home. Treatment with medicines or talk therapy may be used for depression and attention-deficit disorder.Many "behavioral modification" schools, "wilderness programs," and "boot camps" are sold to parents as solutions for conduct disorder. There is no research to support these programs. Research does suggest that treating children at home, along with their families, is more effective.Children who are diagnosed and treated early usually overcome their behavioral problems.Outlook (Prognosis)

Children who have severe or frequent symptoms and who are not able to complete treatment tend to have the poorest outlook.Possible Complications

Children with conduct disorder may go on to develop personality disorders as adults, particularly antisocial personality disorder. As their behaviors worsen, these individuals may also develop problems with drug abuse and the law.Depression and bipolar disorder may develop in the teen years and early adulthood. Suicide and violence toward others are also possible complications.When to Contact a Medical Professional

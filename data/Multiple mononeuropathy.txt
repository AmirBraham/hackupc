 Multiple mononeuropathy is a nervous system disorder that involves damage to at least two separate nerve areas. Neuropathy means damage to a peripheral nerve.Causes

Multiple mononeuropathy is a form of damage to one or more peripheral nerves. These are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It is a group of symptoms (syndrome), not a disease.However, certain diseases can cause the injury or nerve damage that leads to the symptoms of multiple mononeuropathy. Common conditions include:Blood vessel diseases such as polyarteritis nodosaConnective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (the most common cause in children)DiabetesLess common causes include:Amyloidosis, an abnormal buildup of proteins in tissues and organsBlood disorders (such as hypereosinophilia and cryoglobulinemia)Infections such as Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS, or hepatitisLeprosySarcoidosis, which also may cause inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissuesSj√∂gren syndrome, a disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyedGranulomatosis with polyangiitis, an inflammation of the blood vesselSymptoms

Symptoms depend on the specific nerves involved, and may include:Loss of bladder or bowel controlLoss of sensation in one or more areas of the bodyParalysis in one or more areas of the bodyTingling, burning, pain, or other abnormal sensations in one or more areas of the bodyWeakness in one or more areas of the body Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms, focusing on the nervous system.To diagnose this syndrome, there usually needs to be problems with two or more unrelated nerve areas. Common nerves affected are the:Axillary nerve in either arm or shoulderCommon peroneal nerve in the lower legDistal median nerve to the handFemoral nerve in the thighRadial nerve in the armSciatic nerve in the back of the legUlnar nerve in the arm Tests may include:Electromyogram (EMG, a recording of electrical activity in the muscles)Nerve biopsy to examine a piece of the nerve under a microscopeNerve conduction tests to measure how fast nerve impulses move along the nerveImaging tests, such as x-rays Blood tests that may be done include:Antinuclear antibody panel (ANA)Blood chemistry testsC-reactive proteinImaging scansPregnancy testRheumatoid factorSedimentation rateThyroid testsX-rays Treatment

The goals of treatment are to:Treat the illness that is causing the problem, if possibleProvide supportive care to maintain independenceControl symptoms To improve independence, treatments may include:Occupational therapyOrthopedic help (for example, a wheelchair, braces, and splints)Physical therapy (for example, exercises and retraining to increase muscle strength)Vocational therapy Safety is an important for people with sensation or movement problems. Lack of muscle control and decreased sensation may increase the risk for falls or injuries. Safety measures include:Having adequate lighting (such as leaving lights on at night)Installing railingsRemoving obstacles (such as loose rugs that may slip on the floor)Testing water temperature before bathingWearing protective shoes (no open toes or high heels) Check shoes often for grit or rough spots that may injure the feet.People with decreased sensation should check their feet (or other affected area) often for bruises, open skin areas, or other injuries that may go unnoticed. These injuries may become severely damaged or infected because the pain nerves of the area are not signaling the injury.People with multiple mononeuropathy are prone to new nerve injuries at pressure points such as the knees and elbows. They should avoid putting pressure on these areas, for example, by not leaning on the elbows, crossing the knees, or holding similar positions for long periods.Medicines that may help include:Over-the-counter or prescription pain drugsAntiseizure or antidepressant drugs to reduce stabbing pains Outlook (Prognosis)

A full recovery is possible if the cause is found and treated, and if the nerve damage is limited. Some people have no disability. Others have a partial or complete loss of movement, function, or sensation.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Deformity, loss of tissue or muscle massDisturbances of organ functionsMedicine side effectsRepeated or unnoticed injury to the affected area due to lack of sensationRelationship problems due to erectile dysfunctionWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you notice signs of multiple mononeuropathy.Prevention

Preventive measures depend on the specific disorder. For example, with diabetes, eating healthy foods and keeping a tight control of blood sugar may help prevent multiple mononeuropathy from developing.Alternative Names

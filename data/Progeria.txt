 Progeria is a rare genetic condition that produces rapid aging in children.Causes

Progeria is a rare condition. It is remarkable because its symptoms strongly resemble normal human aging, but it occurs in young children. In most cases, it is not passed down through families. It is rarely seen in more than one child in a family.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Growth failure during the first year of lifeNarrow, shrunken or wrinkled faceBaldnessLoss of eyebrows and eyelashesShort statureLarge head for size of face (macrocephaly)Open soft spot of the skull (fontanelle)Small jaw (micrognathia)Dry, scaly, thin skinLimited range of motionTeeth - delayed or absent formationExams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and order laboratory tests. This may show:Insulin resistanceSkin changes similar to that seen in scleroderma (the connective tissue becomes tough and hardened)Generally normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels Cardiac stress testing may reveal signs of early atherosclerosis of blood vessels.Genetic testing can detect changes in the gene (LMNA) that causes progeria.Treatment

There is no specific treatment for progeria. Aspirin and statin medicines may be used to protect against a heart attack or stroke.Support Groups

Progeria causes early death. People with the condition most often only live to their teenage years (average lifespan of 14 years). However, some can live into their early 20s. The cause of death is very often related to the heart or a stroke.Possible Complications

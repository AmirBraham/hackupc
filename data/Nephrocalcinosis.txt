 Nephrocalcinosis is a disorder in which there is too much calcium deposited in the kidneys. It is common in premature babies.Causes

Any disorder that leads to high levels of calcium in the blood or urine may lead to nephrocalcinosis. In this disorder, calcium deposits in the kidney tissue itself. Most of the time, both kidneys are affected.Nephrocalcinosis is related to, but not the same as, kidney stones (nephrolithiasis).Conditions that can cause nephrocalcinosis include:Alport syndromeBartter syndromeChronic glomerulonephritisFamilial hypomagnesemiaMedullary sponge kidneyPrimary hyperoxaluriaRenal transplant rejectionRenal tubular acidosis (RTA)Renal cortical necrosisOther possible causes of nephrocalcinosis include:Ethylene glycol toxicityHypercalcemia (excess calcium in the blood) due to hyperparathyroidism or other medical conditionsHypercalciuria (excess calcium in the urine)Use of certain medicines, such as acetazolamide, amphotericin B, and triamtereneSarcoidosisTuberculosis of the kidney and infections related to AIDSVitamin D toxicitySymptoms

Most of the time, there are no early symptoms of nephrocalcinosis beyond those of the condition causing the problem.People who also have kidney stones may have:Blood in the urineFever and chillsNausea and vomitingSevere pain in the belly area, sides of the back (flank), groin, or testiclesLater symptoms related to nephrocalcinosis may be associated with long-term (chronic) kidney failure.Exams and Tests

Nephrocalcinosis may be discovered when symptoms of renal insufficiency, kidney failure, obstructive uropathy, or urinary tract stones develop.Imaging tests can help diagnose this condition. Tests that may be done include:Abdominal CT scanUltrasound of the kidney Other tests that may be done to diagnose and determine the severity of associated disorders include:Blood tests to check levels of calcium, phosphate, uric acid, and parathyroid hormoneUrinalysis to see crystals and check for red blood cells24-hour urine collection to measure acidity and levels of calcium, sodium, uric acid, oxalate, and citrateTreatment

The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms, prevent more calcium from building up in the kidneys, and reduce kidney damage.Treatment will involve methods to reduce abnormal levels of calcium, phosphate, and oxalate in the blood and urine. Options include making changes in your diet and taking medicines and supplements.If you take medicine that causes calcium loss, your health care provider will tell you to stop taking it. Never stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.Other symptoms, including kidney stones, should be treated as appropriate.Outlook (Prognosis)

What to expect depends on the complications and cause of the disorder.Proper treatment may help prevent further deposits in the kidneys. In most cases, there is no way to remove deposits that have already formed. Many deposits of calcium in the kidneys do not always mean severe damage to the kidneys.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Acute kidney failureLong-term (chronic) kidney failureKidney stonesObstructive uropathy (acute or chronic, unilateral or bilateral)When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you know you have a disorder that causes high levels of calcium in your blood and urine. Also call if you develop symptoms of nephrocalcinosis.Prevention

Prompt treatment of disorders that lead to nephrocalcinosis, including RTA, may help prevent it from developing. Drinking plenty of water to keep the kidneys flushed and draining will help prevent or decrease stone formation as well.Patient Instructions

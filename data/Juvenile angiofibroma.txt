 Juvenile angiofibroma is a noncancerous growth that causes bleeding in the nose and sinuses. It is most often seen in boys and young adult men.Causes

Juvenile angiofibroma is not very common. It is most often found in adolescent boys. The tumor contains many blood vessels andÂ spreads within the area in which it started (locally invasive). This can cause bone damage.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Difficulty breathing through the noseEasy bruisingFrequent or repeated nosebleedsHeadacheSwelling of the cheekHearing lossNasal discharge, usually bloodyProlonged bleedingStuffy nose Exams and Tests

The health care provider may see the angiofibroma when examining the upper throat.Tests that may be done include:Arteriogram to see the blood supply to the growthCT scan of the sinusesMRI scan of the headX-rayBiopsy is generally not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding.Treatment

You will need treatment if the angiofibroma is growing larger, blocking the airways, or causing repeated nosebleeds. In some cases, no treatment is needed.Surgery may be needed to remove the tumor. The tumor may be hard to remove if it is not enclosed and has spread to other areas. Newer surgery techniques that place a camera up through the nose have made tumor removal surgery less invasive.A procedure called embolization may be done to prevent the tumor from bleeding. The procedure may correct the nosebleeds by itself, but it is most often followed by surgery to remove the tumor.Outlook (Prognosis)

Although not cancerous, angiofibromas may continue to grow and damage nearby tissue or bleed. Some may disappear on their own.It is common for the tumor to return after surgery.Possible Complications

Complications may include:AnemiaPressure on the brain (rare)Spread of the tumor to the nose, sinuses, and other structuresWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

There is no known way to prevent this condition.Alternative Names

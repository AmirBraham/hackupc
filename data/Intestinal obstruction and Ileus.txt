 Intestinal obstruction is a partial or complete blockage of the bowel. The contents of the intestine cannot pass through it.Causes

Obstruction of the bowel may be due to:
   A mechanical cause, which means something is blocking the bowel
   Ileus, a condition in which the bowel does not work correctly, but there is no structural problem causing it
   Paralytic ileus, also called pseudo-obstruction, is one of the major causes of intestinal obstruction in infants and children. Causes of paralytic ileus may include:Bacteria or viruses that cause intestinal infections (gastroenteritis)Chemical, electrolyte, or mineral imbalances (such as decreased blood potassium level)Abdominal surgeryDecreased blood supply to the intestinesInfections inside the abdomen, such as appendicitisKidney or lung diseaseUse of certain medicines, especially narcotics Mechanical causes of intestinal obstruction may include:Adhesions or scar tissue that form after surgeryForeign bodies (objects that are swallowed and block the intestines)Gallstones (rare)HerniasImpacted stoolIntussusception (telescoping of one segment of bowel into another)Tumors blocking the intestinesVolvulus (twisted intestine) Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Abdominal swelling (distention)Abdominal fullness, gasAbdominal pain and crampingBreath odorConstipationDiarrheaInability to pass gasVomitingExams and Tests

During a physical exam, the health care provider may find bloating, tenderness, or hernias in the abdomen. Tests that show obstruction include:Abdominal CT scanAbdominal x-rayBarium enemaUpper GI and small bowel seriesTreatment

Treatment involves placing a tube through the nose into the stomach or intestine. This is to help relieve abdominal swelling (distention) and vomiting. Volvulus of the large bowel may be treated by passing a tube into the rectum.Surgery may be needed to relieve the obstruction if the tube does not relieve the symptoms. It may also be needed if there are signs of tissue death.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome depends on the cause of the blockage. Most of the time, the cause is successfully treated.Possible Complications

Complications may include or may lead to:Electrolyte (blood chemical and mineral) imbalancesDehydrationHole (perforation) in the intestineInfectionJaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) If the obstruction blocks the blood supply to the intestine, it may cause infection and tissue death (gangrene). Risks for tissue death are related to the cause of the blockage and how long it has been present. Hernias, volvulus, and intussusception carry a higher gangrene risk. In a newborn, paralytic ileus that destroys the bowel wall (necrotizing enterocolitis) is a life-threatening condition. It may lead to blood and lung infections.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you: Cannot pass stool or gasHave a swollen abdomen (distention) that does not go awayKeep vomitingHave unexplained abdominal pain that does not go awayPrevention

Prevention depends on the cause. Treating conditions, such as tumors and hernias that can lead to a blockage, may reduce your risk. Some causes of obstruction cannot be prevented.Alternative Names

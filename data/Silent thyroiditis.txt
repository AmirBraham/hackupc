 Silent thyroiditis is an immune reaction of the thyroid gland. The disorder can cause hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism.The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.Causes

The cause of the disease is unknown. But it is related to an attack against the thyroid by the immune system. The disease affects women more often than men.The disease can occur in women who have just had a baby. It can also be caused by medicines such as interferon and amiodarone, and some types of chemotherapy, which affect the immune system.Symptoms

The earliest symptoms result from an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). These symptoms may last for up to 3 months.Symptoms are often mild, and may include:Fatigue, feeling weak
   
   Frequent bowel movements
   Heat intoleranceIncreased appetiteIncreased sweating
   Irregular menstrual periodsMood changes, such as irritabilityMuscle crampsNervousness, restlessnessPalpitationsWeight loss Later symptoms may be of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), including:FatigueConstipationDry skinWeight gainCold intoleranceThese symptoms can persist until the thyroid recovers normal function. The recovery of the thyroid can take many months in some people. Some people only notice the hypothyroid symptoms and do not have symptoms of hyperthyroidism to begin with.Exams and Tests

Treatment is based on symptoms. Medicines called beta-blockers may be used to relieve rapid heart rate and excessive sweating.Outlook (Prognosis)

Silent thyroiditis often goes away on its own within 1 year. The acute phase usually ends within 3 months.Some people develop hypothyroidism over time. They need to be treated for a while with a medicine that replaces thyroid hormone. Regular follow-ups with a provider are recommended.The disease is not infectious.

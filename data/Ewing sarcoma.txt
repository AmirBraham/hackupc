 Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that forms in the bone or soft tissue. It affects mostly teens and young adults.Causes

Ewing sarcoma can occur anytime during childhood and young adulthood. But it usually develops during puberty, when bones are growing rapidly. It is more common in White children than in Black or Asian children.The tumor may start anywhere in the body. Most often, it starts in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It can also develop in the skull or the flat bones of the trunk.The tumor often spreads (metastasizes) to the lungs and other bones. At the time of diagnosis, spread is seen in about one third of children with Ewing sarcoma. In rare cases, Ewing sarcoma occurs in adults.Symptoms

There are few symptoms. The most common is pain and sometimes swelling at the site of the tumor.Children may also break a bone at the site of the tumor after a minor injury.Fever may also be present.Exams and Tests

If a tumor is suspected, tests to locate the primary tumor and any spread (metastasis) often include:Bone scanChest x-rayCT scan of the chestMRI of the tumorX-ray of the tumorA biopsy of the tumor will be done. Different tests are done on this tissue to help determine how aggressive the cancer is and what treatment may be best.Treatment

Treatment often includes a combination of:ChemotherapyRadiation therapySurgery to remove the primary tumorTreatment depends on the following:Stage of the cancerAge and sex of the personResults of the tests on the biopsy sample Support Groups

The stress of illness can be eased by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.Outlook (Prognosis)

Before treatment, outlook depends on:Whether the tumor has spread to distant parts of the bodyWhere in the body the tumor startedHow large the tumor is when it's diagnosedWhether the LDH level in the blood is higher than normalWhether the tumor has certain gene changesWhether the child is younger than 15 yearsChild's sexWhether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcomaWhether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has come backThe best chance for cure is with a combination of treatments that includes chemotherapy plus radiation or surgery.Possible Complications

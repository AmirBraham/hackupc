 Endometritis is an inflammation or irritation of the lining of the uterus (the endometrium). It is not the same as endometriosis.Causes

Endometritis is caused by an infection in the uterus. It can be due to chlamydia, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, or a mix of normal vaginal bacteria. It is more likely to occur after miscarriage or childbirth. It is also more common after a long labor or C-section.The risk for endometritis is higher after having a pelvic procedure that is done through the cervix. Such procedures include:D and C (dilation and curettage)Endometrial biopsyHysteroscopyPlacement of an intrauterine device (IUD) Childbirth (more common after C-section than vaginal birth)Endometritis can occur at the same time as other pelvic infections.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Swelling of the abdomenAbnormal vaginal bleeding or dischargeDiscomfort with bowel movement (including constipation)FeverGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feelingPain in lower abdomen or pelvic region (uterine pain) Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam with a pelvic exam. Your uterus and cervix may be tender and your provider may not hear bowel sounds. You may have cervical discharge.The following tests may be performed:Cultures from the cervix for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other organismsEndometrial biopsyESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate)LaparoscopyWBC (white blood count)Wet prep (microscopic exam of any discharge) Treatment

You will need to take antibiotics to treat the infection and prevent complications. Finish all your medicine if you have been given antibiotics after a pelvic procedure. Also, go to all recommended follow-up visits with your provider. You may need to be treated in the hospital if your symptoms are severe or occur after childbirth. Other treatments may involve:Fluids through a vein (by IV)Rest Sexual partners may need to be treated if the condition is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI).Outlook (Prognosis)

In most cases, the condition goes away with antibiotics. Untreated endometritis can lead to more serious infections and complications. Rarely, it may be associated with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer.Possible Complications

Endometritis may be caused by STIs.

Women having a C-section may have antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infections.Images

 Diskitis is swelling (inflammation) and irritation of the space between the bones of the spine (intervertebral disk space).Causes

Diskitis is an uncommon condition. It is usually seen in children younger than 10 years and in adults around 50 years of age. Men are more affected than women.Diskitis can be caused by an infection from bacteria or a virus. It can also be caused by inflammation, such as from autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which the immune system mistakenly attacks certain cells in the body.Disks in the neck and low back are most commonly affected.Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Abdominal painBack painDifficulty getting up and standingFever (typically 102°F or 38.9°C or lower)Increased curvature of the backIrritabilityNeck painSweating at nightRecent flu-like symptomsRefusal to sit up, stand, or walk (younger child)Stiffness in back Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.Tests that may be ordered include any of the following:Bone scan
   Complete blood count (CBC)ESR or C-reactive protein to measure inflammationMRI of the spineX-ray of the spine Treatment

The goal is to treat the cause of the inflammation or infection and reduce pain. Treatment may involve any of the following:Antibiotics if the infection is caused by bacteriaAnti-inflammatory medicines if the cause is an autoimmune diseasePain medicines such as NSAIDsBed rest or a brace to keep the back from movingSurgery if other methods don't workOutlook (Prognosis)

Children with an infection should fully recover after treatment. In rare cases, chronic back pain persists.In cases of autoimmune disease, the outcome depends on the underlying condition. These are often chronic illnesses that need long-term medical care.Possible Complications

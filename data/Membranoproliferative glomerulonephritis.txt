 Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a kidney disorder that involves inflammation and changes to kidney cells. It may lead to kidney failure.Causes

Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomeruli. The glomeruli of the kidney help filter wastes and fluids from the blood to form urine.Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a form of glomerulonephritis caused by an abnormal immune response. Deposits of antibodies build up in a part of the kidneys called the glomerular basement membrane. This membrane helps filter wastes and extra fluids from the blood.Damage to this membrane affects the kidney's ability to create urine normally. It may allow blood and protein to leak into the urine. If enough protein leaks into the urine, fluid may leak out of the blood vessels into body tissues, leading to swelling (edema). Nitrogen waste products may also build up in the blood (azotemia).The 2 forms of this disease are MPGN I and MPGN II.Most people with the disease have type I. MPGN II is much less common. It also tends to get worse faster than MPGN I.Causes of MPGN may include:Autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sj√∂gren syndrome, sarcoidosis)
   Cancer (leukemia, lymphoma)Infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, endocarditis, malaria)Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Blood in the urineChanges in mental status such as decreased alertness or decreased concentrationCloudy urineDark urine (smoke, cola, or tea colored)Decrease in urine volumeSwelling of any part of the bodyExams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The provider may find that you have signs of too much fluid in the body, such as:Swelling, often in the legsAbnormal sounds when listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscopeYou may have high blood pressureThe following tests help confirm the diagnosis:BUN and creatinine blood testBlood complement levelsUrinalysisUrine proteinKidney biopsy (to confirm membranoproliferative GN I or II)Treatment

Treatment depends on the symptoms. The goals of treatment are to reduce symptoms, prevent complications, and slow the progression of the disorder.You may need a change in diet. This may include limiting sodium, fluids, or protein to help control high blood pressure, swelling, and the buildup of waste products in the blood.Medicines that may be prescribed include:Blood pressure medicinesDipyridamole, with or without aspirinDiureticsMedicines to suppress the immune system, such as cyclophosphamideSteroidsTreatment is more effective in children than in adults. Dialysis or kidney transplant may eventually be needed to manage kidney failure.Outlook (Prognosis)

The disorder often slowly gets worse and eventually results in chronic kidney failure. Half of people with this condition develop long-term (chronic) kidney failure within 10 years. This is more likely in those who have higher levels of protein in their urine.Possible Complications

Complications that may result from this disease include:Acute nephritic syndromeAcute renal failureChronic kidney diseaseWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if:You have symptoms of this conditionYour symptoms get worse or do not go awayYou develop new symptoms, including decreased urine outputPrevention

Preventing infections such as hepatitis or managing diseases such as lupus may help prevent MPGN.Alternative Names

 Basal ganglia dysfunction is a problem with the deep brain structures that help start and control movement.Causes

Watch this video about:Athetosis resulting from basal ganglia injuryAny condition that can cause brain injury can damage the basal ganglia. Such conditions include:Carbon monoxide poisoningDrug overdoseHead injuryInfectionLiver diseaseMetabolic problemsMultiple sclerosis (MS)Poisoning with copper, manganese, or other heavy metalsStrokeTumors A common cause of the symptoms of basal ganglia dysfunction is chronic use of medicines used to treat schizophrenia.Many brain disorders are associated with basal ganglia dysfunction. They include:Dystonia (muscle tone problems)Huntington disease (nerve cells in certain parts of the brain waste away, or degenerate)Multiple system atrophy (widespread nervous system disorder)Parkinson diseaseProgressive supranuclear palsy (movement disorder from damage to certain nerve cells in the brain)Wilson disease (disorder causing too much copper in the body's tissues) Symptoms

Damage to the basal ganglia cells may cause problems controlling speech, movement, and posture. This combination of symptoms is called parkinsonism. A person with basal ganglia dysfunction may have trouble starting, stopping, or sustaining movement. Depending on which area of the brain is affected, there may also be problems with memory and other thought processes.In general, symptoms vary and may include:Movement changes, such as involuntary or slowed movementsIncreased muscle toneMuscle spasms and muscle rigidityProblems finding wordsTremorUncontrollable, repeated movements, speech, or cries (tics)Walking difficultyExams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms and medical history.Blood and imaging tests may be needed. These may include:CT and MRI of the headGenetic testingMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to look at the blood vessels in the neck and brainPositron emission tomography (PET) to look at the metabolism of the brainBlood tests to check blood sugar, thyroid function, liver function, and iron and copper levels Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause of the disorder.Outlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on the cause of the dysfunction. Some causes are reversible, while others require lifelong treatment.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if you have any:Abnormal or involuntary movementsFalls without known reasonIf you or others notice that you are shaky or slowAlternative Names

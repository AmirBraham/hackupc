 Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. It affects one or more brain functions such as memory, thinking, language, judgment, or behavior.Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes over time.Dementia may also be referred to as major neurocognitive disorder.Causes

Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease in people over age 65.Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes.A stroke is brain damage due to a blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.When strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia. Risk factors for vascular dementia include:DiabetesHardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)Heart diseaseHigh blood pressure (hypertension)SmokingStroke or other vascular diseaseSymptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain. One such disorder is Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of Alzheimer disease can be similar to those of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease are the most common causes of dementia, and may occur together.Symptoms

Symptoms of vascular dementia may develop gradually or may progress after each small stroke.Symptoms may begin suddenly after each stroke. Some people with vascular dementia may improve for short periods, but decline after having more silent strokes. Symptoms of vascular dementia will depend on the areas of the brain that are injured due to the stroke.Early symptoms of vascular dementia can include:Difficulty performing cognitive tasks that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routinesGetting lost on familiar routesLanguage problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objectsLosing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat moodMisplacing itemsPersonality changes and loss of social skills as well as behavioral changesMood changes leading to aggressive behaviorPoor performance of job dutiesAs dementia worsens, symptoms are more obvious and the ability to take care of oneself declines. Symptoms may include:Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at nightDifficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or drivingForgetting details about current eventsForgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you areHaving delusions, depression, or agitationHaving hallucinations, arguments, striking out, or violent behaviorHaving more difficulty reading or writingHaving poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize dangerUsing the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, or speaking in confusing sentencesWithdrawing from social contact Nervous system (neurologic) problems that occur with a stroke may also be present.Exams and Tests

A skilled health care provider can often diagnose vascular dementia using the following:Complete physical exam, including nervous system examAsking about the person's medical history and symptomsMental function tests (mental status examination)Neuropsychological testingTests may be ordered to help determine whether other medical problems could be causing dementia or making it worse, such as:AnemiaBrain tumorChronic infectionDrug and medicine intoxication (overdose)Electrocardiogram (ECG)Severe depressionThyroid diseaseVitamin deficiency Other tests may be done to find out what parts of thinking have been affected and to guide other tests such as neuropsychological testing.Tests that can show evidence of previous strokes in the brain may include:Head CT scanMRI of the brainTreatment

There is no treatment to repair damage to the brain caused by small strokes.An important goal is to control symptoms and correct the risk factors. To prevent future strokes:Avoid fatty foods. Follow a healthy, low-fat diet.Do not drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day.Keep blood pressure lower than 130/80 mm/Hg. Ask your provider what your blood pressure should be.Keep LDL (bad) cholesterol lower than 70 mg/dL.Do not smoke.Your provider may suggest blood thinners, such as aspirin, to help prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. Do not start taking aspirin or stop taking it without talking to your provider first. The goals of helping someone with dementia in the home are to:Manage behavior problems, confusion, sleep problems, and agitationRemove safety hazards in the homeSupport family members and other caregivers Medicines may be needed to control aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors.Medicines used to treat Alzheimer disease have not been shown to work for vascular dementia.Outlook (Prognosis)

Some improvement may occur for short periods, but the disorder will generally get worse over time. Possible Complications

Complications include the following:Future strokesHeart diseaseLoss of ability to function or care for selfLoss of ability to interactPneumoniaPressure soresSkin infectionsUrinary tract infectionsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if symptoms of vascular dementia occur. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if there is a sudden change in mental status, sensation, or movement. These are emergency symptoms of stroke.Prevention

Control conditions that increase the risk of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) by:Controlling high blood pressureControlling weightStopping the use of tobacco productsReducing saturated fats and salt in the dietTreating related disorders Alternative Names

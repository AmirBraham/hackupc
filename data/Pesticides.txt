 Pesticides are pest-killing substances that help protect plants against molds, fungi, rodents, noxious weeds, and insects.Pesticides help prevent crop loss and, potentially, human disease.According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, there are currently more than 865 registered pesticides.Human-made pesticides are regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture. This agency determines how pesticides are applied during farming and how much pesticide residue can remain in foods sold in stores.Exposure to pesticides can happen in the workplace, through foods that are eaten, and in the home or garden.Side Effects

For those not exposed to pesticides at work, the risks of exposure from eating nonorganic foods or using pesticides around the home and garden is not clear. To date, research has not been able to prove or disprove claims that organic food is safer than food grown using pesticides.
FOOD AND PESTICIDES
To help protect yourself and your family from pesticides on nonorganic fruits and vegetables, discard the outer leaves of leafy vegetables and then rinse the vegetables well with tap water. Peel hard-skinned produce, or rinse it with lots of warm water mixed with salt and lemon juice or vinegar. Organic growers do not use pesticides on their fruits and vegetables.

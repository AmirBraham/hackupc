 Mesenteric angiography is a test used to look at the blood vessels that supply the small and large intestines.Angiography is an imaging test that uses x-rays and a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.How the Test is Performed

This test is done in a hospital. You will lie on an x-ray table. You may ask for medicine to help you relax (sedative) if you need it.During the test, your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing will be checked.The health care provider will shave and clean the groin. A numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin over an artery. A needle is inserted into an artery.A thin flexible tube called a catheter is passed through the needle. It is moved into the artery, and up through the main vessels of the belly area until it is properly placed into a mesenteric artery. The doctor uses x-rays as a guide. The doctor can see live images of the area on a TV-like monitor.Contrast dye is injected through this tube to see if there are any problems with the blood vessels. X-ray images are taken of the artery.Certain treatments can be done during this procedure. These items are passed through the catheter to the area in the artery that needs treatment. These include:Dissolving a blood clot with medicineOpening a partially blocked artery with a balloonPlacing a small tube called a stent into an artery to help hold it openAfter the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The leg where the needle was placed is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.How to Prepare for the Test

You should not eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.You will be asked to wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure. Remove jewelry from the area being imaged.Tell your provider:If you are pregnantIf you have ever had any allergic reactions to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substancesIf you are allergic to any medicinesWhich medicines you are taking (including any herbal preparations)If you have ever had any bleeding problems How the Test will Feel

You may feel a brief sting when the numbing medicine is given. You will feel a brief sharp pain and some pressure as the catheter is placed and moved into the artery. In most cases, you will feel only a sensation of pressure in the groin area.As the dye is injected, you will feel a warm, flushing sensation. You may have tenderness and bruising at the site of the catheter insertion after the test.Why the Test is Performed

This test is done:When there are symptoms of a narrowed or blocked blood vessel in the intestinesTo find the source of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tractTo find the cause of ongoing abdominal pain and weight loss when no cause can be identifiedWhen other studies do not provide enough information about abnormal growths along the intestinal tractTo look at blood vessel damage after an abdominal injury A mesenteric angiogram may be performed after more sensitive nuclear medicine scans have identified active bleeding. The radiologist can then pinpoint and treat the source.Normal Results

Results are normal if the examined arteries are normal in appearance.What Abnormal Results Mean

A common abnormal finding is narrowing and hardening of the arteries that supply the large and small intestine. This can cause mesenteric ischemia in which the intestine does not receive enough blood to function normally. The problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries.Abnormal results may also be due to bleeding in the small and large intestine. This may be caused by:Angiodysplasia of the colonBlood vessel rupture from injury Other abnormal results may be due to:Blood clotsCirrhosisTumorsRisks

There is some risk of the catheter damaging the artery or knocking loose a piece of the artery wall. This can reduce or block blood flow and lead to tissue death. This is a rare complication.Other risks include:Allergic reaction to the contrast dyeDamage to the blood vessel where the needle and catheter are insertedExcessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the legHeart attack or strokeHematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle punctureInfectionInjury to the nerves at the needle puncture siteKidney damage from the dyeDamage to the intestine if the blood supply is reduced Considerations

To make a diagnosis, your doctor may also perform a computed tomography (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before or in place of catheter angiography.Alternative Names

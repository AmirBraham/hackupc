 Toxic nodular goiter involves an enlarged thyroid gland. The gland contains areas that have increased in size and formed nodules. One or more of these nodules produce too much thyroid hormone.Causes

Toxic nodular goiter starts from an existing simple goiter. It occurs most often in older adults. Risk factors include being female and over 55 years old. This disorder is rare in children. Most people who develop it have had a goiter with nodules for many years. Sometimes the thyroid gland is only slightly enlarged, and the goiter was not already diagnosed.Sometimes, people with toxic multinodular goiter will develop high thyroid levels for the first time. This may occur after:Taking iodine through a vein (intravenously) or by mouth. The iodine may be used as contrast for a CT scan or heart catheterization (most common)Taking medicines that contain iodine, such as amiodaroneMoving from a country with iodine deficiency to a country with a lot of iodine in the dietSymptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:FatigueFrequent bowel movementsHeat intoleranceIncreased appetiteIncreased sweatingIrregular menstrual period (in women)Muscle crampsNervousnessRestlessnessWeight lossOlder adults may have symptoms that are less specific. These may include:Weakness and fatiguePalpitations and chest pain or pressureChanges in memory and moodToxic nodular goiter does not cause the bulging eyes that can occur with Graves disease. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).Exams and Tests

A physical exam may show one or many nodules in the thyroid. The thyroid is often enlarged. There may be a rapid heart rate or a tremor.Other tests that may be done include:Serum thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4)
   Serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
   Thyroid uptake and scan or radioactive iodine uptakeThyroid ultrasoundTreatment

Beta-blockers can control some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism until thyroid hormone levels in the body are under control.Certain medicines can block or change how the thyroid gland uses iodine. These may be used to control the overactive thyroid gland in any of the following cases:Before surgery or radioiodine therapy occursAs a long term treatmentRadioiodine therapy may be used. Radioactive iodine is given by mouth. It concentrates in the overactive thyroid tissue and causes damage. In rare cases, thyroid replacement is needed afterward.Surgery to remove the thyroid may be done when:Very large goiter or a goiter is causing symptoms by making it hard to breathe or swallowThyroid cancer is presentRapid treatment is neededOutlook (Prognosis)

Toxic nodular goiter is mainly a disease of older adults. So, other chronic health problems may affect the outcome of this condition. An older adult may be less able to tolerate the effect of the disease on the heart. However, the condition is often treatable with medicines.Possible Complications

Heart complications:Heart failureIrregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation)
   Rapid heart rate
   Other complications:
   Bone loss leading to osteoporosisThyroid crisis or storm is a sudden worsening of hyperthyroidism symptoms. It may occur with infection or stress. Thyroid crisis may cause:
   Abdominal pain
   
   Decreased mental alertness
   
   Fever
   People with this condition need to go to the hospital right away.Complications of having a very large goiter may include difficulty breathing or swallowing. This is due to pressure on the airway passage (trachea) or esophagus, which lies behind the thyroid.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of this disorder listed above. Follow your provider's instructions for follow-up visits.Prevention

To prevent toxic nodular goiter, treat hyperthyroidism and simple goiter as your provider suggests.Alternative Names

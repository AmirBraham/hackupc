 Enlarged liver refers to swelling of the liver beyond its normal size. Hepatomegaly is another word to describe this problem.If both the liver and spleen are enlarged, it is called hepatosplenomegaly.Considerations

The lower edge of the liver normally comes just to the lower edge of the ribs on the right side. The edge of the liver is normally thin and firm. It cannot be felt with the fingertips below the edge of the ribs, except when you take a deep breath. It may be enlarged if a health care provider can feel it in this area.Causes

The liver is involved in many of the body's functions. Its function is affected by many conditions that can cause hepatomegaly, including:Alcohol use (especially alcohol abuse)Cancer metastases (spread of cancer to the liver)Congestive heart failureGlycogen storage diseaseHepatitis AHepatitis BHepatitis CHepatocellular carcinomaHereditary fructose intoleranceInfectious mononucleosisLeukemiaNiemann-Pick diseasePrimary biliary cholangitisReye syndromeSarcoidosisSclerosing cholangitisPortal vein thrombosisSteatosis (fat in the liver from metabolic problems such as diabetes, obesity, and high triglycerides, also called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH)When to Contact a Medical Professional

This condition is most often detected by a provider. You may not be aware of the liver or spleen swelling.What to Expect at Your Office Visit

The venom of tarantulas found in the United States is not considered dangerous, but it may cause allergic reactions.Where Found

Tarantulas are found across the southern and southwestern regions of the United States. Some people keep them as pets. As a group, they are found mainly in tropical and subtropical areas.Symptoms

If a tarantula bites you, you may have pain at the site of the bite similar to a bee sting. The area of the bite may become warm and red. When one of these spiders is threatened, it rubs its hind legs across its own body surface and flicks thousands of tiny hairs toward the threat. These hairs have barbs that can pierce human skin. This causes causing swollen, itchy bumps to form. Itching may last for weeks.If you are allergic to tarantula venom, these symptoms may occur:Breathing difficultyLoss of blood flow to major organs (an extreme reaction)Eyelid puffinessItchinessLow blood pressure and collapse (shock)Rapid heart rateSkin rashSwelling at the site of the biteSwelling of the lips and throat Home Care

Seek medical help right away.Wash the area with soap and water. Place ice (wrapped in a clean cloth or other covering) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, reduce the time the ice is used to prevent possible skin damage.Before Calling Emergency

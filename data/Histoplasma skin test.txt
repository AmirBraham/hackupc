Your health care provider cleans an area of your skin, usually the forearm. An allergen is injected just below the cleaned skin surface. An allergen is a substance that causes an allergic reaction. The injection site is checked at 24 hours and at 48 hours for signs of a reaction. Occasionally, the reaction may not appear until the fourth day.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is necessary for this test.How the Test will Feel

You may feel a brief sting as the needle is inserted just below the skin.Why the Test is Performed

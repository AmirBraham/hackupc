 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).Causes

MS affects women more often than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 30 to 40, but it can be seen at any age.MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop.The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord.It is unknown what exactly causes MS. The most common thought is that it is caused by a virus, a gene defect, or both. Environmental factors may also play a role.You are slightly more likely to develop this condition if you have a family history of MS or you live in a part of the world where MS is more common (areas further from the equator).Symptoms

Symptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different. Attacks can last for days, weeks, or months. Attacks are followed by remissions. These are periods of reduced symptoms or no symptoms. Fever, hot baths, sun exposure, and stress can trigger or worsen attacks.Nerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be damaged. Because of this, MS symptoms can appear in many parts of the body.Muscle symptoms:Loss of balanceMuscle spasmsNumbness or abnormal sensation in any areaProblems moving arms or legsProblems walkingProblems with coordination and making small movementsTremor in one or more arms or legsWeakness in one or more arms or legs Bowel and bladder symptoms:Constipation and stool leakageDifficulty beginning to urinateFrequent need to urinateStrong urge to urinateUrine leakage (incontinence) Eye symptoms:Double visionEye discomfortUncontrollable eye movementsVision loss (usually affects one eye at a time) Numbness, tingling, or pain:Facial painPainful muscle spasmsTingling, crawling, or burning feeling in the arms and legs Other brain and nerve symptoms:Decreased attention span, poor judgment, and memory lossDifficulty reasoning and solving problemsDepression or feelings of sadnessDizziness and balance problemsHearing lossSexual symptoms:Problems with erectionsProblems with vaginal lubrication Speech and swallowing symptoms:Slurred or difficult-to-understand speechTrouble chewing and swallowing Fatigue is a common and bothersome symptom as MS progresses. It is often worse in the late afternoon.Exams and Tests

Symptoms of MS may mimic those of many other nervous system problems. MS is diagnosed by determining if there are signs of more than one attack on the brain or spinal cord and by ruling out other conditions.People who have a form of MS called relapsing-remitting MS have evidence of at least two attacks separated by a remission.In other people, the disease may slowly get worse in between clear attacks. This form is called secondary progressive MS. A form with gradual progression, but no clear attacks is called primary progressive MS.Your health care provider may suspect MS if there are decreases in the function of two different parts of the central nervous system (such as abnormal reflexes) at two different times.An exam of the nervous system may show reduced nerve function in one area of the body. Or the reduced nerve function may be spread over many parts of the body. This may include:Abnormal nerve reflexesDecreased ability to move a part of the bodyDecreased or abnormal sensationOther loss of nervous system functions, such as vision An eye exam may show:Abnormal pupil responsesChanges in the visual fieldsÂ Changes in eye movementsDamage to the nerve in the eye (optic nerve atrophy)Decreased visual acuityProblems with the inside parts of the eyeRapid eye movements triggered when the eye moves Tests to diagnose MS include:Blood tests to check for other conditions that are similar to MS.Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, including CSF oligoclonal banding may be needed.MRI scan of the brain or the spine, or both are important to help diagnose and follow MS.Nerve function study (evoked potential test, such as visual evoked response) is less often used. Treatment

There is no known cure for MS at this time, but there are treatments that may slow the disease. The goal of treatment is to stop progression, control symptoms, and help you maintain a normal quality of life.Medicines are often taken long-term. These include:Medicines to slow the diseaseSteroids to decrease the severity of attacksMedicines to control symptoms such as muscle spasms, urinary problems, fatigue, or mood problems Medicines are more effective for the relapsing-remitting form than for other forms of MS.The following may also be helpful for people with MS:Physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and support groupsAssistive devices, such as wheelchairs, bed lifts, shower chairs, walkers, and wall barsA planned exercise program early in the course of the disorderA healthy lifestyle, with good nutrition and enough rest and relaxationAvoiding fatigue, stress, temperature extremes, and illnessChanges in what you eat or drink if there are swallowing problemsMaking changes around the home to prevent fallsSocial workers or other counseling services to help you cope with the disorder and get assistanceVitamin D or other supplements (talk to your provider first)Complementary and alternative approaches, such as acupuncture or cannabis, to help with muscle problemsSpinal devices can reduce pain and spasticity in the legsSupport Groups

Living with MS may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by joining an MS support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome varies, and is hard to predict. Although the disorder is life-long (chronic) and incurable, life expectancy can be normal or almost normal. Most people with MS are active and function at work with little disability.Those who usually have the best outlook are:FemalesPeople who were young (less than 30 years old) when the disease startedPeople with infrequent attacksPeople with a relapsing-remitting patternPeople who have limited disease on imaging studies The amount of disability and discomfort depends on:How often and severe the attacks areThe part of the central nervous system that is affected by each attack Most people return to normal or near-normal function between attacks. Over time, there is greater loss of function with less improvement between attacks.Possible Complications

MS may lead to the following:DepressionDifficulty swallowingDifficulty thinkingLess and less ability to care for selfNeed for indwelling urinary catheterOsteoporosis or thinning of the bonesPressure soresSide effects of medicines used to treat the disorderUrinary tract infectionsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

 The rotavirus antigen test detects rotavirus in the feces. This is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in children.How the Test is Performed

There are many ways to collect stool samples. You can catch the stool on plastic wrap that is loosely placed over the toilet bowl and held in place by the toilet seat. Then you put the sample into a clean container.One type of test kit supplies a special toilet tissue to collect the sample, which is then placed in a container.For infants and young children wearing diapers, line the diaper with plastic wrap. Position the plastic wrap to prevent urine and stool from mixing in order to get a better sample. The sample should be collected while the diarrhea is occurring. Take the sample to the lab to be checked. How to Prepare for the Test

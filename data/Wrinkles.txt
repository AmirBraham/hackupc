Stay out of the sun as much as possible to limit skin wrinkles. Wear hats and clothing that protect your skin and use sunscreen daily. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Wrinkles are not usually a cause for concern unless they occur at an early age. Talk to your health care provider if you think that your skin is getting wrinkled faster than normal for someone your age or if you would like to consider cosmetic treatments for normal wrinkles from aging. A skin specialist (dermatologist) or a plastic surgeon can discuss non-surgical or surgical treatment options with you.What to Expect at Your Office Visit

Your provider will ask questions, such as:When did you first notice that your skin seemed more wrinkled than normal?Has it changed in any way?Has a skin spot become painful or does it bleed?What other symptoms are you having? Your provider will examine your skin. You may need a skin lesion biopsy if you have any abnormal growths or skin changes. These are some treatments for wrinkles:Tretinoin (Retin-A) or creams containing alpha-hydroxy acids (such as glycolic acid)Chemical peels, laser resurfacing, or dermabrasion work well for early wrinklesBotulinum toxin (Botox) may be used to correct some of the wrinkles that are caused by overactive facial musclesMedicines injected under the skin can fill in wrinkles or stimulate collagen productionPlastic surgery for age-related wrinkles (for example, a facelift) Alternative Names

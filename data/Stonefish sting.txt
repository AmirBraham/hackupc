Seek medical help right away. Contact your local emergency services.For superficial stings to an arm or leg, you can take the following first aid steps while waiting for medical help.Immediately get out of the water and into a safe environment.Control any bleeding that occurs by applying direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage.Next soak the wound with hot water. The water should be around 100°F to 113°F (40°C to 45°C) or as hot as can be comfortably tolerated. Soak for 30 to 90 minutes, periodically checking to make sure the water is still warm. Soaking in hot water helps to inactivate the venom and relieve pain. After soaking, gently wash the wound with mild soap and clean water to remove any dirt, debris, or venom that may be present.Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment unless you have an allergy to this type of medication.Then cover the wound using a sterile bandage or non-stick dressing and tape.Before Calling Emergency

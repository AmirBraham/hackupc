 Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. It affects one or more brain functions such as memory, thinking, language, judgment, or behavior. Dementia may also be referred to as major neurocognitive disorder.Causes

Dementia usually occurs in older age. Most types are rare in people under age 60. The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older.Most types of dementia are nonreversible and degenerative. Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia.Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia. It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke.Lewy body disease is another cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. Any condition that results in injury to the brain can cause dementia.The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia:Huntington diseaseBrain injuryFrontotemporal degenerationMultiple sclerosisInfections such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis, and Lyme diseaseParkinson diseasePick diseaseProgressive supranuclear palsyExcess alcohol useSome causes of dementia, such as those due to abnormal chemical processes in the body, may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including:Brain injuryBrain tumorsLong-term (chronic) alcohol abuseChanges in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levelsLow vitamin B12 levelNormal pressure hydrocephalusUse of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol medicinesSome brain infections Symptoms

Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:Emotional behavior or personalityLanguageMemoryPerceptionThinking and judgment (cognitive skills) Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness.Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which a person has more memory and thinking problems than other people their age. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They often know about their forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops dementia.Symptoms of MCI include:Difficulty doing more than one task at a timeDifficulty solving problems or making decisionsForgetting names of familiar people, recent events, or conversationsTaking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of dementia can include:Difficulty with tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routinesGetting lost on familiar routesLanguage problems, such as trouble with the names of familiar objectsLosing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat moodMisplacing itemsPersonality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviorsÂ Mood changes leading to aggressive behaviorPoor performance of job dutiesAs dementia becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include:Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at nightDifficulty with basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or drivingForgetting details about current eventsForgetting events in one's own life history, or losing self-awarenessHaving hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behaviorHaving delusions, depression, and agitationMore difficulty reading or writingPoor judgment and loss of ability to recognize dangerUsing the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentencesWithdrawing from social contact People with severe dementia can no longer:Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathingRecognize family membersUnderstand language Other symptoms that may occur with dementia:Problems controlling bowel movements or urineSwallowing problems Exams and Tests

A skilled health care provider can often diagnose dementia using the following:Complete physical exam, including nervous system examAsking about the person's medical history and symptomsMental function tests (mental status examination)Neuropsychological testingOther tests may be ordered to find out if other problems may be causing dementia or making it worse. These conditions include:AnemiaBrain tumorLong-term (chronic) infectionIntoxication from medicinesSevere depressionThyroid diseaseVitamin deficiencyThe following tests and procedures may be done:B12 levelBlood ammonia levelBlood chemistry (chem-20)Blood gas analysisCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysisDrug or alcohol levels (toxicology screen)Electroencephalograph (EEG)Head CTMental status testNeuropsychological testMRI of headThyroid function tests, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)UrinalysisTreatment

Treatment depends on the condition causing the dementia. Some people may need to stay in the hospital for a short time.Sometimes, medicines given for any condition, including dementia, can make a person's confusion worse. Stopping or changing these medicines is part of the treatment.Certain mental exercises can help with dementia.Treating conditions that can lead to dementia symptoms often greatly improve mental function. Such conditions include:AnemiaDecreased blood oxygen (hypoxia)DepressionHeart failureInfectionsNutritional disordersThyroid disorders Medicines may be used to:Slow the rate at which symptoms get worse, though improvement with these medicines may be smallControl problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion Someone with dementia will need support in the home as the condition gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can assist by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems. It is important to make sure the homes of people who have dementia are safe for them. Outlook (Prognosis)

People with MCI do not always develop dementia. When dementia does occur, it usually gets worse over time. Dementia often decreases quality of life and lifespan. Families will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care. The prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Some dementias rapidly progress to death while others can take years to get worse.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Most causes of dementia are not preventable.The risk of vascular dementia may be reduced by preventing strokes through:Eating healthy foodsExercisingQuitting smokingControlling high blood pressureManaging diabetes Alternative Names

 Tropical sprue is a condition that occurs in people who live in or visit tropical areas for extended periods of time. It impairs nutrients from being absorbed from the intestines.Tropical sprue (TS) is a syndrome characterized by acute or chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption of nutrients.Causes

This disease is caused by damage to the lining of the small intestine. It comes from having too much of certain types of bacteria in the intestines.Risk factors are:Living in the tropicsLong periods of travel to tropical destinations Symptoms

Symptoms include:Abdominal crampsDiarrhea, worse on a high-fat dietExcess gas (flatus)FatigueFeverLeg swellingWeight lossSymptoms may not appear for up to 10 years after leaving the tropics.Exams and Tests

There is no clear marker or test that clearly diagnoses this problem.Certain tests help to confirm that poor absorption of nutrients is present:D-xylose is a lab test to see how well the intestines absorb a simple sugarTests of the stool to see if fat is absorbed correctlyBlood tests to measure iron, folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin DComplete blood count (CBC)Tests that examine the small intestine may include:EnteroscopyUpper endoscopyBiopsy of the small intestineUpper GI seriesTreatment

Treatment begins with plenty of fluids and electrolytes. Replacement of folate, iron, vitamin B12, and other nutrients may also be needed. Antibiotic therapy with tetracycline or Bactrim is typically given for 3 to 6 months.In most cases, oral tetracycline is not prescribed for children until after all the permanent teeth have come in. This medicine can permanently discolor teeth that are still forming. However, other antibiotics can be used.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome is good with treatment.Possible Complications

Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common.In children, sprue leads to:Delay in the maturing of bones (skeletal maturation)Growth failureWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

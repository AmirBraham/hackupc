 Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.Bacteria are one type of germ that can cause meningitis. The pneumococcal bacteria are one kind of bacteria that cause meningitis.Causes

Pneumococcal meningitis is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria (also called pneumococcus, or S pneumoniae). This type of bacteria is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. It is the second most common cause of meningitis in children older than age 2.Risk factors include:Alcohol useDiabetesHistory of meningitisInfection of a heart valve with S pneumoniaeInjury or trauma to the headMeningitis in which there is leakage of spinal fluidRecent ear infection with S pneumoniaeRecent pneumonia with S pneumoniaeRecent upper respiratory infectionSpleen removal or a spleen that does not functionSymptoms

Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include:
  Fever and chillsMental status changesNausea and vomitingSensitivity to light (photophobia)Severe headache
  Stiff neck
  Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:AgitationBulging fontanelles in infantsDecreased consciousnessPoor feeding or irritability in childrenRapid breathingUnusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards (opisthotonos)Pneumococcal meningitis is an important cause of fever in infants.Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Questions will focus on symptoms and possible exposure to someone who might have the same symptoms, such as a stiff neck and fever.If the provider thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) will likely be done. This is to obtain a sample of spinal fluid for testing.Other tests that may be done include:Blood cultureChest x-rayCT scan of the headGram stain or other special stains, and culture of the spinal fluidTreatment

Antibiotics will be started as soon as possible. Ceftriaxone is one of the most commonly used antibiotics.If the antibiotic is not working and the provider suspects antibiotic resistance, vancomycin or rifampin are used. Sometimes, corticosteroids are used.Outlook (Prognosis)

Meningitis is a dangerous infection and it can be deadly. The sooner it is treated, the better the chance for recovery. Young children and adults over age 50 have the highest risk for death.Possible Complications

Long-term complications may include:Brain damageBuildup of fluid between the skull and brain (subdural effusion)Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus)Hearing lossSeizuresWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:Feeding problemsHigh-pitched cryIrritabilityPersistent unexplained feverMeningitis can quickly become a life-threatening illness.Prevention

Early treatment of pneumonia and ear infections caused by pneumococcus may decrease the risk of meningitis. There are also two effective vaccines available to prevent pneumococcus infection:Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23)Pneumococcal conjugate vaccineThe following people should be vaccinated, according to current recommendations:ChildrenAdults age 65 and olderPeople at high risk for pneumococcus infectionAlternative Names

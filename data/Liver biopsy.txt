 A liver biopsy is a test that takes a sample of tissue from the liver for examination.How the Test is Performed

Most of the time, the test is done in the hospital or specialized procedure unit. Before the test is done, you may be given a medicine to prevent pain or to calm you (sedative).The biopsy may be done through the abdominal wall:You will lie on your back with your right hand under your head. You need to stay as still as you can.The health care provider will find the correct spot for the biopsy needle to be inserted into the liver. This is often done by using ultrasound.The skin is cleaned, and numbing medicine is injected into the area using a small needle.A small cut is made, and the biopsy needle is inserted.You will be told to hold your breath while the biopsy is taken. This is to reduce the chance of damage to the lung or liver.The needle is removed quickly.Pressure will be applied to stop the bleeding. A bandage is placed over the insertion site.The procedure can also be done by inserting a needle into your liver by moving it through the jugular vein.If the procedure is performed this way, you will lie on your back.X-rays will be used to guide the provider to the vein.A special needle and catheter (thin tube) is used to take the biopsy sample.If you receive sedation for this test, you will need someone to drive you home.How to Prepare for the Test

Tell your provider about:Bleeding problemsDrug allergiesMedicines you are taking including herbs, supplements, or medicines you bought without a prescriptionWhether you are pregnant You must sign a consent form. Blood tests are sometimes done to test your blood's ability to clot. You will be told not to eat or drink anything for the 8 hours before the test.For infants and children:The preparation needed for a child depends on the child's age and maturity. Your child's provider will tell you what you can do to prepare your child for this test.How the Test will Feel

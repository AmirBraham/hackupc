 Kwashiorkor is a form of malnutrition that occurs when there is not enough protein in the diet.Causes

Kwashiorkor is most common in areas where there is:FamineLimited food supplyLow levels of education (when people do not understand how to eat a proper diet)This disease is more common in very poor countries. It may occur during:Drought or other natural disasterPolitical unrestThese events often lead to a lack of food, causing malnutrition.Kwashiorkor is rare in children in the United States. There are only isolated cases. However, one government estimate suggests that as many as half of old age people living in nursing homes in the United States do not get enough protein in their diet.When kwashiorkor does occur in the United States, it is most often a sign of child abuse and severe neglect.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Changes in skin pigmentDecreased muscle massDiarrheaFailure to gain weight and growFatigueHair changes (change in color or texture)Increased and more severe infections due to damaged immune systemIrritabilityLarge belly that sticks out (protrudes)Lethargy or apathyLoss of muscle massRash (dermatitis)Shock (late stage)Swelling (edema) Exams and Tests

The physical exam may show an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and general swelling.Tests may include:Arterial blood gasBUNComplete blood count (CBC)
  Creatinine clearanceSerum creatinineSerum potassiumTotal protein levels
  UrinalysisTreatment

People who start early treatment can recover fully. The goal is to get more calories and protein into their diet. Children with the disease cannot reach their complete height and growth.Calories are given first in the form of carbohydrates, simple sugars, and fats. Proteins are started after other sources of calories have already provided energy. Vitamin and mineral supplements will be given.Food must be restarted slowly since the person has been without much food for a long period of time. Suddenly eating high-calorie foods can cause problems.Many malnourished children will develop intolerance to milk sugar (lactose intolerance). They will need to be given supplements with the enzyme lactase so that they can tolerate milk products.People who are in shock need treatment right away to restore blood volume and maintain blood pressure.Outlook (Prognosis)

Getting treatment early generally leads to good results. Treating kwashiorkor in its late stages will improve the child's general health. However, the child may be left with permanent physical and mental problems. If treatment is not given or comes too late, this condition is life threatening.Possible Complications

Complications may include:ComaPermanent mental and physical disabilityShockWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

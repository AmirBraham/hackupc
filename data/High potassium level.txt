 High potassium level is a problem in which the amount of potassium in the blood is higher than normal. The medical name of this condition is hyperkalemia.Causes

Potassium is needed for cells to function properly. You get potassium through food. Your kidneys remove excess potassium through the urine to keep a proper balance of this mineral in your body.If your kidneys are not working well, they may not be able to remove the proper amount of potassium. As a result, potassium can build up in the blood. This buildup can also be due to: Addison disease -- Disease in which the adrenal glands do not make enough hormones, reducing the kidneys' ability to remove potassium from the bodyBurns over large areas of the bodyCertain blood pressure lowering drugs, most often angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)Damage to muscle and other cells from certain illicit street drugs, alcohol abuse, untreated seizures, surgery, crush injuries and falls, certain chemotherapies, or certain infectionsDisorders that cause red blood cells to burst (hemolytic anemia)Severe bleeding from the stomach or intestinesTaking extra potassium, such as salt substitutes or supplementsTumorsSymptoms

There are often no symptoms with a high level of potassium. When symptoms do occur, they may include:Chest painDifficulty breathingNausea or vomitingPalpitations (irregular or abnormal-feeling heartbeats)Slow, weak, or irregular pulseSudden collapse, when the heartbeat gets too slow or even stopsExams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.Tests that may be ordered include:Electrocardiogram (ECG)Blood potassium levelYour provider will likely check your blood potassium level and do kidney blood tests on a regular basis if you:Have been prescribed extra potassiumHave long-term (chronic) kidney diseaseTake medicines to treat heart disease or high blood pressureUse salt substitutes Treatment

You will need emergency treatment if your potassium level is very high, or if you have danger signs, such as changes in your ECG.Emergency treatment may include:Calcium given into your veins (IV) to treat the muscle and heart effects of high potassium levelsGlucose and insulin given into your veins (IV) to help lower potassium levels long enough to correct the causeKidney dialysis if your kidney function is poorMedicines that help remove potassium from the intestines before it is absorbedSodium bicarbonate if the problem is caused by acidosisSome diuretics (most often given by vein) that increase the excretion of potassium by your kidneys into your urineChanges in your diet can help both prevent and treat high potassium levels. You may be asked to:Limit or avoid asparagus, avocados, potatoes, tomatoes or tomato sauce, winter squash, pumpkin, and cooked spinachLimit or avoid oranges and orange juice, nectarines, kiwifruit, raisins, or other dried fruit, bananas, cantaloupe, honeydew, prunes, and nectarinesLimit or avoid taking salt substitutes if you are asked to follow a low-salt dietYour provider may make the following changes to your medicines:Reduce or stop potassium supplementsStop or change the doses of medicines you are taking, such as ones for heart disease and high blood pressureTake a certain type of water pill to reduce potassium and fluid levels if you have chronic kidney failureFollow your provider's directions when taking your medicines:DO NOT stop or start taking medicines without first talking to your providerTake your medicines on timeTell your provider about any other medicines, vitamins, or supplements you are takingOutlook (Prognosis)

If the cause is known, such as too much potassium in the diet, the outlook is good once the problem is corrected. In severe cases or those with ongoing risk factors, high potassium will likely recur.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Heart suddenly stops beating (cardiac arrest)Kidney failureWeaknessWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider right away if you have vomiting, palpitations, weakness, or difficulty breathing, or if you're taking a potassium supplement and have symptoms of high potassium.Alternative Names

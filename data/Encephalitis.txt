 Encephalitis is irritation and swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections.Causes

Encephalitis is a rare condition. It occurs more often in the first year of life and decreases with age. The very young and older adults are more likely to have a severe case.Encephalitis is most often caused by a virus. Many types of viruses may cause it. Exposure can occur through:Breathing in droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat from an infected person
 Contaminated food or drink
 
 Mosquito, tick, and other insect bites
 
 Skin contact
 Different viruses occur in different geographic locations. Many cases occur during a certain season.Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the leading cause of more severe cases in all ages, including newborns.Routine vaccination has greatly reduced encephalitis due to some viruses, including:MeaslesMumpsPolioRabiesRubellaVaricella (chickenpox)
 Other viruses that cause encephalitis include:
 Adenovirus
 
 Coxsackievirus
 Cytomegalovirus
Eastern equine encephalitis virus
 
 Echovirus
 
 Japanese encephalitis, which occurs in Asia
 West Nile virusAfter the virus enters the body, the brain tissue swells. This swelling may destroy nerve cells, and cause bleeding in the brain and brain damage.Other causes of encephalitis may include:An allergic reaction to vaccinations
 Autoimmune disease
 Bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis
 
 Parasites such as roundworms, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis in people with HIV/AIDS and other people who have a weakened immune system
 The effects of cancer Symptoms

Some people may have symptoms of a cold or stomach infection before encephalitis symptoms begin.When this infection is not very severe, the symptoms may be similar to those of other illnesses:Fever that is not very highMild headacheLow energy and a poor appetiteOther symptoms include: 
 Clumsiness, unsteady gait 
 Confusion, disorientationDrowsinessIrritability or poor temper controlLight sensitivityStiff neck and back (sometimes)VomitingSymptoms in newborns and younger infants may not be as easy to recognize:Body stiffnessIrritability and crying more often (these symptoms may get worse when the baby is picked up)Poor feedingSoft spot on the top of the head may bulge out moreVomitingEmergency symptoms: 
 Loss of consciousness, poor responsiveness, stupor, coma 
 Muscle weakness or paralysis 
 SeizuresSevere headacheSudden change in mental functions, such as flat mood, impaired judgment, memory loss, or a lack of interest in daily activities Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms.Tests that may be done include:Brain MRICT scan of the headSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)Culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, or urine (however, this test is rarely useful)Electroencephalogram (EEG)Lumbar puncture and CSF examinationTests that detect antibodies to a virus (serology tests)Test that detects tiny amounts of virus DNA (polymerase chain reaction -- PCR)Treatment

The goals of treatment are to provide supportive care (rest, nutrition, fluids) to help the body fight the infection, and to relieve symptoms. Medicines may include:
  Antiviral medicines, if a virus caused the infection
  
  Antibiotics, if bacteria are the cause
  
  Antiseizure medicines to prevent seizures
  
  Steroids to reduce brain swelling
  
  Sedatives for irritability or restlessness
  
  Acetaminophen for fever and headache
  If brain function is severely affected, physical therapy and speech therapy may be needed after the infection is controlled.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome varies. Some cases are mild and short, and the person fully recovers. Other cases are severe, and permanent problems or death is possible.The acute phase normally lasts for 1Â to 2 weeks. Fever and symptoms gradually or suddenly disappear. Some people may take several months to fully recover.Possible Complications

Permanent brain damage may occur in severe cases of encephalitis. It can affect:HearingMemoryMuscle controlSensationSpeechVision When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have:Sudden feverOther symptoms of encephalitisPrevention

Children and adults should avoid contact with anyone who has encephalitis.Controlling mosquitoes (a mosquito bite can transmit some viruses) may reduce the chance of some infections that can lead to encephalitis.Apply an insect repellant containing the chemical, DEET when you go outside (but DO NOT use DEET products on infants younger than 2 months).Remove any sources of standing water (such as old tires, cans, gutters, and wading pools).Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when outside, especially at dusk.Children and adults should get routine vaccinations for viruses that can cause encephalitis. People should receive specific vaccines if they are traveling to places such as parts of Asia, where Japanese encephalitis is found.Vaccinate animals to prevent encephalitis caused by the rabies virus.Patient Instructions

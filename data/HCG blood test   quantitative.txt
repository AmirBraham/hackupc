 A quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG or hCG) blood test measures the specific level of HCG in the blood. HCG is a hormone produced in the body during pregnancy.Other HCG tests include:HCG urine testHCG blood test -- qualitativeHow the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. This is most often taken from a vein. The procedure is called a venipuncture.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is needed.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.Why the Test is Performed

HCG appears in the blood and urine of pregnant women as early as 10 days after conception. Quantitative HCG measurement helps determine the exact age of the fetus. It can also assist in the diagnosis of abnormal pregnancies, such as ectopic pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and possible miscarriages. It is also used as part of a screening test for Down syndrome.This test is also done to diagnose abnormal conditions not related to pregnancy that can raise HCG level.Normal Results

Results are given in milli-international units per milliliter (mUI/mL).Normal levels are found in:Non-pregnant women: less than 5 mIU/mLHealthy men: less than 2 mIU/mLIn pregnancy, HCG level rises rapidly during the first trimester and then declines slightly. The expected HCG ranges in pregnant women are based on the length of the pregnancy.3 weeks: 5 - 72 mIU/mL4 weeks: 10 -708 mIU/mL5 weeks: 217 - 8,245 mIU/mL6 weeks: 152 - 32,177 mIU/mL7 weeks: 4,059 - 153,767 mIU/mL8 weeks: 31,366 - 149,094 mIU/mL9 weeks: 59,109 - 135,901 mIU/mL10 weeks: 44,186 - 170,409 mIU/mL12 weeks: 27,107 - 201,165 mIU/mL14 weeks: 24,302 - 93,646 mIU/mL15 weeks: 12,540 - 69,747 mIU/mL16 weeks: 8,904 - 55,332 mIU/mL17 weeks: 8,240 - 51,793 mIU/mL18 weeks: 9,649 - 55,271 mIU/mLNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test result.What Abnormal Results Mean

Higher than normal level may indicate:More than one fetus, for example, twins or tripletsChoriocarcinoma of the uterusHydatidiform mole of the uterusOvarian cancerTesticular cancer (in men)During pregnancy, lower than normal levels based on the gestational age may indicate:Fetal deathIncomplete miscarriageThreatened spontaneous abortion (miscarriage)Ectopic pregnancyRisks

Risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:Excessive bleedingFainting or feeling lightheadedBlood accumulating under the skin (hematoma)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)Alternative Names

Serial beta HCG; Repeat quantitative beta HCG; Human chorionic gonadotropin blood test - quantitative; Beta-HCG blood test - quantitative; Pregnancy test - blood - quantitativeImages

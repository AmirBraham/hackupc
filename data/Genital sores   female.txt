 Sores or lesions on the female genitalia or in the vagina may occur for many reasons. Considerations

Genital sores may be painful or itchy, or may produce no symptoms. Other symptoms that may be present include pain when you urinate or painful sexual intercourse. Depending on the cause, a discharge from the vagina may be present.Causes

Infections spread through sexual contact can cause these sores:Genital herpes -- small, painful blisters filled with clear or straw-colored fluidGenital warts -- flesh-colored spots that are raised or flat, and may look like the top of a cauliflowerChancroid -- a small bump in the genitals, which becomes an ulcer within a day of its appearanceSyphilis -- small, painless open sore or ulcer (called a chancre) on the genitalsGranuloma inguinale -- small, beefy-red bumps appear on the genitals or around the anusLymphogranuloma venereum -- small painless sore on the genitalsChanges that may lead to cancer of the vulva (vulvar dysplasia) may appear as white, red, or brown patches on the vulva. These areas may itch. Skin cancers such as melanoma and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas may also be found, but are less common.Other common causes of genital sores include:Long-term (chronic) skin disorder that involves red itchy rashes (atopic dermatitis)Skin that becomes red, sore, or inflamed after contact with perfumes, detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches (contact dermatitis)Cysts or abscesses of the Bartholin or other glandsTrauma or scratchesFlu-type viruses that can cause genital sores or ulcers in some casesInflammation of the hair follicles (folliculitis)Molluscum contagiosumHome Care

See a health care provider before treating yourself. Self-treatment may make it harder for your provider to find the source of the problem. A sitz bath may help relieve itching and crusting.If the sores are caused by a sexually transmitted infection, your sexual partner may need to be tested and treated as well. Do not have any type of sexual activity until your provider says the sores can no longer be spread to others.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you:Find any unexplained genital soreHave a change in a genital soreHave genital itching that does not go away with home careThink you might have a sexually transmitted infectionHave pelvic pain, fever, vaginal bleeding, or other new symptoms as well as genital soresWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit

Questions may include:What does the sore look like? Where is it located?When did you first notice it?Do you have more than one sore?Does it hurt or itch?

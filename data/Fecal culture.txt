Do not mix urine, water, or toilet tissue with the sample.For children wearing diapers:Line the diaper with plastic wrap.Position the plastic wrap so that it will prevent urine and stool from mixing. This will provide a better sample. Return the sample to the laboratory as soon as possible. Do not include toilet paper or urine in the specimen. In the lab, a technician places a sample of the specimen in a special dish. The dish is then filled with a gel that boosts the growth of bacteria or other germs. If there is growth, the germs are identified. The lab technician may also do more tests to determine the best treatment.How to Prepare for the Test

 Lipase is a protein (enzyme) released by the pancreas into the small intestine. It helps the body absorb fat. This test is used to measure the amount of lipase in the blood.How the Test is Performed

A sample of blood will be taken from a vein. How to Prepare for the Test

Do not eat for 8 hours before the test.Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking medicines that may affect the test, such as:Birth control pillsCholinergic medicinesIndomethacinOpiates (codeine, meperidine, and morphine)Thiazide diureticsHow the Test will Feel

You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. There may be some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Veins and arteries vary in size, so it may be harder to take a blood sample from one person than another.Why the Test is Performed

This test is done to check for disease of the pancreas, most often acute pancreatitis.Lipase appears in excessive amounts in the blood when the pancreas is damaged.Normal Results

In general, normal results are 0 to 160 units per liter (U/L) or 0 to 2.67 microkat/L (Âµkat/L).Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurement methods. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Higher-than-normal levels may be due to:Blockage of the bowel (bowel obstruction)Celiac diseaseCancer of the pancreasPancreatitisPancreatic or bile duct blockagePancreatic pseudocystPerforated ulcerRenal failureSalivary gland inflammationThis test may also be done for familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency.Risks

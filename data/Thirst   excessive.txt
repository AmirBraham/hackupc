 Excessive thirst is an abnormal feeling of always needing to drink fluids.Considerations

Drinking lots of water is healthy in most cases. The urge to drink too much may be the result of a physical or emotional disease. Excessive thirst may be a symptom of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), which may be due toÂ diabetes.Excessive thirst is a common symptom. It is often the reaction to fluid loss during exercise or to eating salty foods.Causes

Causes may include:A recent salty or spicy mealBleeding enough to cause a large decrease in blood volumeDiabetes mellitusDiabetes insipidusMedicines such as anticholinergics, demeclocycline, diuretics, phenothiazinesLoss of body fluids from the bloodstream into the tissues due to conditions such as severe infections (sepsis) or burns, or heart, liver, or kidney failurePsychogenic polydipsia (a mental disorder)Home Care

Because thirst is the body's signal to replace water loss, it is most often appropriate to drink liquids until the thirst sensation is gone.For thirst caused by diabetes, follow the prescribed treatment to properly control your blood sugar level.When to Contact a Medical Professional

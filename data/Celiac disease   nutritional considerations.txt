 Celiac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, or sometimes oats. It may also be found in some medicines. When a person with celiac disease eats or drinks anything containing gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the lining of the small intestine. This affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients.Carefully following a gluten-free diet helps prevent symptoms of the disease.Food Sources

All items made with all-purpose, white, or wheat flour are prohibited.FOODS YOU CAN EATBeansCereals made without wheat or barley maltCornFruits and vegetablesMeat, poultry, and fish (not breaded or made with regular gravies)Milk-based itemsGluten-free oatsPotatoesRiceGluten-free products such as crackers, pasta, and breadsObvious sources of gluten include:Breaded foodsBreads, bagels, croissants, and bunsCakes, donuts, and piesCereals (most)Crackers and many snacks bought at the store, such as potato chips and tortilla chipsGravyPancakes and wafflesPasta and pizzaÂ (other than gluten-free pasta and pizza crust)Soups (most)StuffingLess obvious foods that must be eliminated include:BeerCandies (some)Cold cuts, hot dogs, salami or sausageCommunion breadsCroutonsSome marinades, sauces, soy, and teriyaki saucesSalad dressings (some)Self-basting turkeyThere is a risk for cross-contamination.

Herpangina is a common childhood infection. It is most often seen in children ages 3 to 10, but it can occur in any age group.It is most often caused by Coxsackie group A viruses. These viruses are contagious. Your child is at risk for herpangina if someone at school or home has the illness.Symptoms

They may be very painful. In most cases, there are only a few sores.Exams and Tests

Tests are not normally necessary. Your health care provider can most often diagnose this condition by doing a physical exam and asking questions about the child's symptoms and medical history.Treatment

The symptoms are treated as necessary:Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) by mouth for fever and discomfort as the provider recommends.Increase fluid intake, especially cold milk products. Gargle with cool water or try eating fruit-flavored ice pops. Avoid hot beverages and citrus fruits.Eat a non-irritating diet. (Cold milk products, including ice cream, are often the best choices during herpangina infection. Fruit juices are too acidic and tend to irritate the mouth sores.) Avoid spicy, fried, or hot foods.Use topical anesthetics for the mouth (these may contain benzocaine or xylocaine and are usually not required).Outlook (Prognosis)

The illness normally clears up within a week. Possible Complications

Dehydration is the most common complication, but it can be treated by your provider.When to Contact a Medical Professional

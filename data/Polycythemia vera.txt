 Polycythemia vera (PV) is a bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in the number of blood cells. The red blood cells are the most affected blood cell type.Causes

PV is a disorder of the bone marrow. It mainly causes too many red blood cells to be produced. The numbers of white blood cells and platelets may also be higher than normal.PV is a rare disorder that occurs more often in men than in women. It is not usually seen in people under age 40. The problem is often linked to a gene defect called JAK2V617F. The cause of this gene defect is unknown. This gene defect is not an inherited disorder.Symptoms

In people with PV, there are too many red blood cells in the blood. This results in thicker blood, which can't flow through small blood vessels normally, leading to symptoms such as:Trouble breathing when lying downDizzinessFeeling tired all the timeFull feeling in the left upper abdomen (due to enlarged spleen)HeadacheItchiness, especially after a warm bathRed skin coloring, especially of the faceShortness of breathSymptoms of blood clots in veins near the skin surface (phlebitis) Vision problemsRinging in the ears (tinnitus)Joint painExams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. You may also have the following tests:Bone marrow biopsyComplete blood count with differentialComprehensive metabolic panelErythropoietin levelGenetic test for the JAK2V617F mutationOxygen saturation of the bloodVitamin B12 levelPV may also affect the results of the following tests:Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)Leukocyte alkaline phosphatasePlatelet aggregation testSerum uric acidPV must be distinguished from other causes of increased red cells.Treatment

The goal of treatment is to reduce the thickness of the blood and prevent bleeding and clotting problems.A method called phlebotomy is used to decrease blood thickness. One unit of blood (about 1 pint, or 1/2 liter) is removed each week until the number of red blood cells drops. The treatment is continued as needed.Medicines that may be used include:Hydroxyurea to reduce the number of red blood cells made by the bone marrow. This drug may be used when the numbers of other blood cell types are also high.Interferon to lower blood counts.Anagrelide to lower platelet counts.Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) to reduce the number of red blood cells and reduce an enlarged spleen. This drug is prescribed when hydroxyurea and other treatments have failed.Taking aspirin to reduce the risk of blood clots may be an option for some people, but aspirin increases the risk for stomach bleeding.Ultraviolet-B light therapy can reduce the severe itching some people experience.Support Groups

PV usually develops slowly. Most people do not have symptoms related to the disease at the time of diagnosis. The condition is often diagnosed before severe symptoms occur.Possible Complications

Complications of PV may include:Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)Bleeding from the stomach or other parts of the intestinal tractGout (painful swelling of a joint)Heart failureMyelofibrosis (disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue)Thrombosis (blood clotting, which can cause a stroke, heart attack, or other body damage)When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if symptoms of PVÂ develop.Alternative Names

 A cytology exam of urine is a test used to detect cancer and other diseases of the urinary tract.How the Test is Performed

Most often, a clean catch urine sample is collected in your health care provider's office or at home. This is done by urinating into a special cup. The clean-catch method helps prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, you will get a clean-catch kit from your provider. It will contain a cup with a lid and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly.The urine sample can also be collected during cystoscopy. During this procedure, your provider uses a thin, tube-like instrument with a camera on the end to examine the inside of your bladder.The urine sample is sent to a lab and examined under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.How to Prepare for the Test

 A sprain is an injury to the ligaments around a joint. Ligaments are strong, flexible fibers that hold bones together. When a ligament is stretched too far or tears, the area around the joint will become painful and swell.Causes

Sprains are caused when a joint is forced to move into an unnatural position. For example, "twisting" one's ankle causes a sprain to the ligaments around the ankle.Symptoms

Symptoms of a sprain include:Joint pain or muscle painSwellingJoint stiffnessDiscoloration of the skin, especially bruisingFirst Aid

First aid steps include:Apply ice right away to reduce swelling. Wrap the ice in cloth. Do not place ice directly on the skin.Wrap a bandage around the affected area to limit movement. Wrap firmly, but not tightly. Use a splint if needed.Keep the swollen joint raised above your heart, even while sleeping.Rest the affected joint for several days.Avoid putting stress on the joint because it can make the injury worse. A sling for the arm, or crutches or a brace for the leg can protect the injury. Aspirin, ibuprofen, or other pain relievers can help. DO NOT give aspirin to children.Keep pressure off the injured area until the pain goes away. Most of the time, a mild sprain will heal in 7 to 10 days. It may take several weeks for pain to go away after a bad sprain. Your health care provider may recommend crutches. Physical therapy can help you regain motion and strength of the injured area.When to Contact a Medical Professional

   Swelling does not start to go away within 2 days.You have symptoms of infection, including red, warm, painful skin or a fever over 100°F (38°C).The pain does not go away after several weeks.Prevention

 Cholestasis is any condition in which the flow of bile from the liver is slowed or blocked.Causes

There are many causes of cholestasis.Extrahepatic cholestasis occurs outside the liver. It can be caused by:
   Bile duct tumors
   
   Cysts affecting the bile duct
   Narrowing of the bile duct (strictures)
   
   Stones in the common bile duct
   
   Pancreatitis
   
   Pancreatic tumor or pseudocyst
   
   Pressure on the bile ducts due to a nearby mass or tumor
   
   Primary sclerosing cholangitis
   Intrahepatic cholestasis occurs inside the liver. It can be caused by:
   Alcoholic liver disease
   
   Amyloidosis
   
   Bacterial abscess in the liver
   
   Being fed exclusively through a vein (IV)
   
   Lymphoma
   
   Pregnancy
   Primary biliary cholangitis (previously called primary biliary cirrhosis)Primary or metastatic liver cancerPrimary sclerosing cholangitisSarcoidosis
   Serious infections that have spread through the bloodstream (sepsis)
   TuberculosisViral hepatitis Certain medicines can also cause cholestasis, including:Antibiotics, such as ampicillin and other penicillinAnabolic steroidsBirth control pillsChlorpromazineCimetidineEstradiolImipramineProchlorperazineTerbinafineTolbutamide Symptoms

Symptoms may include:Clay-colored or pale stoolsDark urineInability to digest certain foodsItchingNausea or vomitingPain in the right upper part of the abdomen Yellow skin or eyesExams and Tests

Blood tests may show that you have elevatedÂ bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.Imaging tests are used to diagnose this condition. Tests include:CT scan of the abdomenMRI of the abdomenMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), can also determine causeUltrasound of the abdomenTreatment

The underlying cause of cholestasis must be treated.Outlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on the disease causing the condition. Stones in the common bile duct can often be removed. This can cure the cholestasis.Stents can be placed to open areas of the common bile duct that are narrowed or blocked by cancers.If the condition is caused by the use of a certain medicine, it will often go away when you stop taking that drug.Possible Complications

Complications may include:DiarrheaOrgan failure can occur if sepsis developsPoor absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitaminsSevere itchingWeak bones (osteomalacia) due to having cholestasis for a very long timeWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

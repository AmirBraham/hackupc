 A single palmar crease is a single line that runs across the palm of the hand. People most often have 3 creases in their palms.The crease is most often referred to as a single palmar crease. The older term "simian crease" is not used much anymore, since it tends to have a negative meaning (the word "simian" refers to a monkey or ape).Considerations

But sometimes, the creases join to form just one.Palmar creases develop while a baby is growing in the womb, most often by the 12th week of gestation.A single palmar crease appears in about 1 out of 30 people. Males are twice as likely as females to have this condition. Some single palmar creases may indicate problems with development and be linked with certain disorders.Causes

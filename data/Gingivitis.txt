 Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums.Causes

Gingivitis is an early form of periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is inflammation and infection that destroys the tissues that support the teeth. This can include the gums, the periodontal ligaments, and bone.Gingivitis is due to the short-term effects of plaque deposits on your teeth. Plaque is a sticky material made up of bacteria, mucus, and food debris that builds up on the teeth both above, and below the gums. It is also a major cause of tooth decay.If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar (or calculus) that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. An excess of bacteria in the mouth, and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become swollen, and tender. This is called an inflammatory response, which is part of the bodyâ€™s natural immune response to invading organisms.These things raise your risk for gingivitis:Certain infections and body-wide (systemic) diseasesPoor dental hygienePregnancy (hormonal changes increase the sensitivity of the gums)Uncontrolled diabetesSmokingMisaligned teeth, rough edges of fillings, and ill-fitting or unclean mouth appliances (such as braces, dentures, bridges, and crowns)Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, bismuth, and some birth control pillsMany people have some amount of gingivitis. It often develops during puberty or early adulthood because of hormonal changes. It may last a long time or come back often, depending on the health of your teeth and gums.Symptoms

Symptoms of gingivitis include:Bleeding gums (when brushing or flossing)Bright red or reddish-purple gumsGums that are tender when touched, but otherwise painlessMouth soresSwollen gumsShiny appearance to gumsBad breathExams and Tests

Your dentist will examine your mouth and teeth and look for soft, swollen, reddish-purple gums.The gums are most often painless or mildly tender when gingivitis is present.Plaque and tartar may be seen at the base of the teeth.Your dentist will use a probe to closely examine your gums to determine if you have gingivitis or Periodontitis. Periodontitis is an advanced form of gingivitis that involves bone and attachment loss.Most of the time, more tests are not needed. However, dental x-rays may be done to see if the disease has spread to the supporting structures of the teeth.Treatment

The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation by removing dental plaque or tartar.Your dentist or dental hygienist will clean your teeth. They may use different tools to loosen and remove deposits from your teeth.Careful oral hygiene is necessary after professional teeth cleaning. Your dentist or hygienist will show you how to brush and floss properly.In addition to brushing and flossing at home, your dentist may recommend:Having professional teeth cleaning twice a year, or three to four times a year for more severe cases of gum diseaseUsing antibacterial mouth rinses or other aidsGetting misaligned teeth straightenedReplacing dental and orthodontic appliancesHaving any other related illnesses or conditions treatedOutlook (Prognosis)

Some people have discomfort when plaque and tartar are removed from their teeth. Bleeding and tenderness of the gums should lessen within 1 or 2 weeks after professional cleaning and with good oral care at home.Warm salt water or antibacterial rinses can reduce gum swelling. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines may also be helpful.You must maintain good oral care throughout your life to keep gum disease from returning. Possible Complications

Good oral hygiene is the best way to prevent gingivitis.Brush your teeth at least twice a day.

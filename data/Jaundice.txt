 Jaundice is a yellow color of the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes. The yellow coloring comes from bilirubin, a byproduct of old red blood cells. Jaundice can be a symptom of several health problems.Causes

A small number of red blood cells in your body die each day, and are replaced by new ones. The liver removes the old blood cells. This creates bilirubin. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed by the body through the stool.Jaundice can occur when too much bilirubin builds up in the body.Jaundice can occur if:Too many red blood cells are dying or breaking down and going to the liver.The liver is overloaded or damaged.The bilirubin from the liver is unable to move normally into the digestive tract. Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Things that can cause jaundice include:Infections, most commonly viralUse of certain drugsCancer of the liver, bile ducts or pancreasBlood disorders, gallstones, birth defects and a number of other medical conditions Symptoms

Jaundice may appear suddenly or develop slowly over time. Symptoms of jaundice commonly include:Yellow skin and the white part of the eyes (sclera) -- when jaundice is more severe, these areas may look brownYellow color inside the mouthDark or brown-colored urinePale or clay-colored stoolsItching (pruritis) usually occurs with jaundice Note: If your skin is yellow and the whites of your eyes are not yellow, you may not have jaundice. Your skin can turn a yellow-to-orange color if you eat a lot of beta carotene, the orange pigment in carrots.Other symptoms depend on the disorder causing the jaundice:Cancers may produce no symptoms, or there may be fatigue, weight loss, or other symptoms.Hepatitis may produce nausea, vomiting, fatigue, or other symptoms.

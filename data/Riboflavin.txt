 Riboflavin is a type of B vitamin. It is water soluble, which means it is not stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins. They have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.Function

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) works with the other B vitamins. It is important for body growth. It helps in red blood cell production. It also aids in the release of energy from proteins.Food Sources

Recommendations for riboflavin, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.
Adequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.Dietary Reference IntakesÂ for riboflavin: 
 Infants0 to 6 months: 0.3* milligrams per day (mg/day)7 to 12 months: 0.4* mg/day*Adequate Intake (AI)Children1 to 3 years: 0.5 mg/day4 to 8 years: 0.6 mg/day9 to 13 years: 0.9 mg/dayAdolescents and adultsMales age 14 and older: 1.3 mg/dayFemales age 14 to 18 years: 1.0 mg/dayFemales age 19 and older: 1.1 mg/dayPregnancy: 1.4 mg/dayLactation: 1.6 mg/dayThe best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods.Alternative Names

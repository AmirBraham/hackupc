 Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a nervous system problem that causes you to feel an unstoppable urge to get up and pace or walk. You feel uncomfortable unless you move your legs. Moving stops the unpleasant feeling for a short time.This disorder is also known as restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED).Causes

No one knows exactly what causes RLS. It may be due to a problem with the way brain cells use dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that helps with muscle movement.RLS may be linked to some other conditions. It may occur more often in people with:Chronic kidney diseaseDiabetesIron, magnesium, or folic acid deficiencyAnemia (often due to iron deficiency)Parkinson diseasePeripheral neuropathyPregnancyMultiple sclerosis RLS may also occur in people who: Use certain medicines such as calcium channel blockers, lithium, or neurolepticsAre stopping sedative useUse caffeine, alcohol, or nicotineRLS occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults. Women are more likely to have RLS than men.RLS is commonly passed down in families. This may be a factor when symptoms start at a younger age. Symptoms

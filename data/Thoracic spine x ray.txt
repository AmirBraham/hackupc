 A thoracic spine x-ray is an x-ray of the 12 chest (thoracic) bones (vertebrae) of the spine. The vertebrae are separated by flat pads of cartilage called disks that provide a cushion between the bones.How the Test is Performed

The test is done in a hospital radiology department or in your health care provider's office. You will lie on the x-ray table in different positions. If the x-ray is checking for an injury, care will be taken to prevent further injury.The x-ray machine will be moved over the thoracic area of the spine. You will hold your breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. Usually, 2 or 3 x-ray views are needed.How to Prepare for the Test

Tell your provider if you are pregnant. Also tell your provider if you have had surgery in your chest, abdomen, or pelvis.Remove all jewelry.How the Test will Feel

The test causes no discomfort. The table may be cold.Why the Test is Performed

The x-ray helps evaluate:Bone injuriesCartilage lossArthritisCurvature in the spineDiseases of the boneTumors of the bone What Abnormal Results Mean

The test can detect:Bone spursDeformities of the spineDisk narrowingDislocationsFractures (most often compression fractures of the vertebrae)Thinning of the bone (osteoporosis)Wearing away (degeneration) of the vertebrae Abnormal alignment of the bone (spondylolisthesis)Risks

There is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays.Considerations

The x-ray will not detect problems in the muscles, nerves, and other soft tissues, because these problems cannot be seen well on an x-ray.Alternative Names

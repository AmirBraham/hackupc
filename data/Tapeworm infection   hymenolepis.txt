 Hymenolepis infection is an infestation by one of two species of tapeworm: Hymenolepis nana or Hymenolepis diminuta. The disease is also called hymenolepiasis.Causes

Hymenolepis worms live in warm climates and are common in the southern United States. Insects eat the eggs of these worms.Humans and other animals become infected when they eat material contaminated by insects (including fleas associated with rats). In an infected person, it is possible for the worm's entire life cycle to be completed in the bowel, so infection can last for years.Hymenolepis nana infections are much more common than Hymenolepis diminuta infections in humans. These infections used to be common in the southeastern United States, in crowded environments, and in people who were confined to institutions. However, the disease occurs throughout the world.Symptoms

Symptoms occur only with heavy infections. Symptoms include:DiarrheaGastrointestinal discomfortItchy anusPoor appetiteWeaknessExams and Tests

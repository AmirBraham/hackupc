 Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a protein found in all body tissues. Tissues with higher amounts of ALP include the liver, bile ducts, and bone.A blood test can be done to measure the level of ALP.A related test is the ALP isoenzyme test. How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. How to Prepare for the Test

Many medicines can interfere with blood test results.Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.How the Test will Feel

You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.Why the Test is Performed

This test may be done:To diagnose liver or bone diseaseTo check if treatments for those diseases are workingTo check for side effects from medicinesNormal Results

The normal range is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkatal per liter (Âµkat/L).Normal values may vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. They also can vary with age and sex. High levels of ALP are normally seen in children undergoing growth spurts and in pregnant women.The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be due to the following conditions:Higher-than-normal ALP levelsBiliary obstructionBone diseaseEating a fatty meal if you have blood type O or BHealing fractureHepatitisHyperparathyroidismHyperthyroidismLeukemiaLiver diseaseLymphomaOsteoblastic bone tumorsOsteomalaciaPaget disease of boneSarcoidosis Lower-than-normal ALP levelsHypophosphatasiaHypothyroidismMalnutritionPernicious anemiaProtein deficiencyWilson diseaseZinc deficiencyOther conditions for which the test may be done:Alcoholic liver disease (hepatitis/cirrhosis)Alcohol use disorderBiliary strictureGallstonesGiant cell (temporal, cranial) arteritisMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIPancreatitisRenal cell carcinomaAlternative Names

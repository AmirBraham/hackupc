 Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of rare diseases in which the body is missing or does not have enough of an enzyme needed to break down long chains of sugar molecules. These chains of molecules are called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems. There are several types of MPSs, including:MPS I (Hurler syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; Scheie syndrome)MPS II (Hunter syndrome)MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome)MPS IV (Morquio syndrome) Alternative Names

MPS; Lysosomal storage disease - mucopolysaccharidosisReferences

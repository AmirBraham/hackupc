The goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms. This may include:Medicines to help your bladder relax. They can reduce the strong urge to urinate or need to urinate frequently.

These include spicy and acidic foods as well as alcohol, citrus juices, and caffeine, and foods that contain them.Performing bladder training exercises to help you schedule times to try to urinate and to delay urination at all other times. One method is to force yourself to delay urinating despite the urge to urinate in between these times. As you become better at waiting this long, slowly increase the time intervals by 15 minutes. Try to reach a goal of urinating every 3 to 4 hours.Avoid pelvic muscle strengthening exercises called Kegel exercises. Outlook (Prognosis)

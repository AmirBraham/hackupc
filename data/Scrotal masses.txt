 A scrotal mass is a lump or bulge that can be felt in the scrotum. The scrotum is the sac that contains the testicles.Causes

A scrotal mass can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).Benign scrotal masses include:Hematocele -- blood collection in the scrotumHydrocele -- fluid collection in the scrotumSpermatocele -- a cyst-like growth in the scrotum that contains fluid and sperm cellsVaricocele -- a varicose vein along the spermatic cordEpididymal cyst -- a swelling in the duct behind the testes that transports spermScrotal abscess -- a collection of pus within the wall of the scrotum Scrotal masses can be caused by:Abnormal bulge in the groin (inguinal hernia)Diseases such as epididymitis or orchitisInjury to the scrotumTesticular torsionTesticular cancerInfections Symptoms

A provider should evaluate all scrotal masses. However, many types of masses are harmless and do not need to be treated unless you are having symptoms.In some cases, the condition may improve with self-care, antibiotics, or pain relievers. You need to get medical attention right away for a growth in the scrotum that is painful.If the scrotal mass is part of the testicle, it has a higher risk of being cancerous. Surgery may be needed to remove the testicle if this is the case. A jock strap or scrotal support may help relieve the pain or discomfort from the scrotal mass. A hematocele, hydrocele, spermatocele, or scrotal abscess may sometimes need surgery to remove the collection of blood, fluid, pus or dead cells.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most conditions that cause scrotal masses can be easily treated. Even testicular cancer has a high cure rate if found and treated early. Have your provider examine any scrotal growth as soon as possible.Possible Complications

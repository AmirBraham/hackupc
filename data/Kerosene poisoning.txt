Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.This is a free and confidential service.

You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.What to Expect at the Emergency Room

Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:Blood and urine testsBreathing support, including oxygen, a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)Bronchoscopy (camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs)Chest x-rayElectrocardiogram (ECG)Endoscopy (camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach)Fluids through a vein (by IV)Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptomsSurgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate the stomach, but only when the person is seen within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning and a very large amount of the poison has been swallowedWashing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several daysOutlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.Swallowing this type of poison can affect many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. Infection, shock, and death can follow, even several months after the poison has been swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing and digestion.If kerosene gets into the lungs (aspiration), serious and, possibly, permanent lung damage can occur.Alternative Names

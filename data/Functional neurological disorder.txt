 Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a condition in which there is a problem with how the brain receives and sends information to one or more parts of the body. FND is not caused by a disease or injury. For reasons not understood, the nervous (neurological) system does not work properly.FND symptoms may include weakness and paralysis of the limbs, seizures, tremors and jerks, and other nervous system symptoms.Causes

FND has no known cause. However, stress or a mental or physical trauma can trigger FND. It can also occur with no known trigger.Certain factors may make a person more susceptible to FND:Having another neurological conditionHaving a mental health conditionChronic pain or fatigueOngoing life stressChildhood abuse, neglect, or traumaFND is uncommon in children under age 10. Before age 50, it is more likely to occur in women. After age 50 it affects both men and women equally.While the cause of FND is unclear, this condition and its symptoms are real. It causes serious distress and cannot be turned on and off at will.Symptoms

FND can cause a variety of symptoms that affect body movement, senses, and thinking:Vision problems (double vision or blindness)Speech problems (slurred speech or loss of speech)Numbness or loss of sensationHearing problemsMemory problemsTrouble concentratingPainFatigueWeakness or paralysisTremors, spasms, jerkiness, ticsInvoluntary repetitive movementsDifficulty walkingLoss of balanceDifficulty swallowingSeizures or episodes of shaking and loss of consciousness (not caused by epilepsy)Exams and Tests

There is no one single test for FND. Your provider will do physical, neurological, and psychiatric exams and may order diagnostic tests. These are to check for medical causes of the symptom.Treatment

The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.The person may receive:X-rays to locate the batteriesBronchoscopy -- camera placed down the throat into the lungs to remove the battery if it is in the windpipe or lungsDirect laryngoscopy -- (a procedure to look into the voice box and vocal cords) or surgery right away if the battery was breathed in and is causing a life-threatening airway blockageEndoscopy -- camera to remove the battery if it was swallowed and is still in the esophagus or stomachFluids by vein (intravenous)Medicines to treat symptomsBlood and urine testsIf the battery has passed through the stomach into the small intestine, the usual treatment is to do another x-ray in 1 to 2 days to make sure the battery is moving through the intestines.The battery should continue to be followed with x-rays until it passes in the stool. If nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain develop, it may mean that the battery has caused a blockage of the intestines. If this happens, surgery may be needed to remove the battery and reverse the blockage.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most swallowed batteries pass through the stomach and intestines without causing any serious damage.How well someone does depends on the type of battery they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.Burns in the esophagus and stomach may result in ulcers and fluid leakage. This can lead to serious infection and possibly surgery. Complications become more likely the longer the battery is in contact with internal structures.Alternative Names

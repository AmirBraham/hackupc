 Acoustic trauma is injury to the hearing mechanisms in the inner ear. It is due to very loud noise.Causes

Acoustic trauma is a common cause of sensory hearing loss. Damage to the hearing mechanisms within the inner ear may be caused by:Explosion near the earFiring a gun near the earLong-term exposure to loud noises (such as loud music or machinery) Any very loud noise near the earSymptoms

Symptoms include:Partial hearing loss that most often involves repeated long-term exposures to loud or high-pitched sounds. The hearing loss may slowly get worse.Noises, ringing in the ear (tinnitus).Exams and Tests

The health care provider will most often suspect acoustic trauma if hearing loss occurs after noise exposure. A physical exam will determine if the eardrum is damaged. Audiometry may determine how much hearing has been lost.Treatment

The hearing loss may not be treatable. The goal of treatment is to protect the ear from further damage. Eardrum repair may be needed.A hearing aid may help you communicate. You can also learn coping skills, such as lip reading.In some cases, your doctor may prescribe steroid medicine to help bring back some of the hearing.Outlook (Prognosis)

Hearing loss may be permanent in the affected ear. Wearing ear protection when around sources of loud sounds may prevent the hearing loss from getting worse.Possible Complications

 B and T cell screen is a laboratory test to determine the amount of B and T lymphocytes in the blood.How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. Blood could also be obtained by capillary sample (fingerstick or heel stick in infants).After the blood is drawn, it goes through a two-step process. First, the lymphocytes are separated from other blood parts. Once the cells are separated, identifiers are added to distinguish between T and B cells.How to Prepare for the Test

Tell your health care provider if you have had any of the following, which might affect your T and B cell count:ChemotherapyHIV/AIDSRadiation therapyRecent or current infectionSteroid therapyStressSurgeryHow the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.Why the Test is Performed

Your provider may order this test if you have signs of certain diseases that weaken the immune system. It may also be used to distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous disease, particularly cancers that involve the blood and bone marrow.The test may also be used to determine how well treatment for certain conditions is working.Normal Results

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal B and T cell counts may suggest a possible disease. Further testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis.An increased T cell count may be due to:Cancer of white blood cells called lymphoblasts (acute lymphoblastic leukemia)Cancer of white blood cells called lymphocytes (chronic lymphocytic leukemia)A viral infection called infectious mononucleosisBlood cancer that starts in the plasma cells in the bone marrow (multiple myeloma)Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease (STD)Toxoplasmosis, an infection due to a parasiteTuberculosis An increased B cell count may be due to:Chronic lymphocytic leukemiaDiGeorge syndromeMultiple myelomaWaldenström macroglobulinemiaA decreased T cell count may be due to:Congenital T-cell deficiency disease, such as Nezelof syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, or Wiskott-Aldrich syndromeAcquired T-cell deficiency states, such as HIV infection or HTLV-1 infectionB cell proliferative disorders, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Waldenström macroglobulinemia A decreased B cell count may be due to:HIV/AIDSAcute lymphoblastic leukemiaImmunodeficiency disordersTreatment with certain medicines Risks

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:Excessive bleedingFainting or feeling lightheadedHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)Alternative Names

E-rosetting; T and B lymphocyte assays; B and T lymphocyte assaysReferences

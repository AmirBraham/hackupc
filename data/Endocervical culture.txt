 Endocervical culture is a laboratory test that helps identify infection in the female genital tract.How the Test is Performed

During a vaginal examination, the health care provider uses a swab to take samples of mucus and cells from the endocervix. This is the area around the opening of the uterus. The samples are sent to a lab. There, they are placed in a special dish (culture). They are then watched to see if bacteria, virus, or fungus grow. Further tests may be done to identify the specific organism and determine the best treatment.How to Prepare for the Test

In the 2 days before the procedure: Do not use creams or other medicines in the vagina. Do not douche. (You should never douche. Douching can cause infection of the vagina or uterus.)Avoid intercourse.Empty your bladder and bowel.At your provider's office, follow instructions for preparing for the vaginal exam.How the Test will Feel

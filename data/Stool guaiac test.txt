 The stool guaiac test looks for hidden (occult) blood in a stool sample. It can find blood even if you cannot see it yourself. It is the most common type of fecal occult blood test (FOBT).Guaiac is a substance from a plant that is used to coat the FOBT test cards.How the Test is Performed

Usually, you collect a small sample of stool at home. Sometimes, a health care provider may collect a small amount of stool from you during a rectal examination.If the test is done at home, you will use a test kit. Follow the kit instructions exactly. This ensures accurate results. In brief:You collect a stool sample from 3 different bowel movements.For each bowel movement, you smear a small amount of the stool on a card provided in the kit.You mail the card to a laboratory for testing.Be sure to keep the stool away from any urine. Mixing of urine and stool can spoil the sample.How to Prepare for the Test

Some foods can affect test results. Follow instructions about not eating certain foods before the test. These may include:Red meatCantaloupeUncooked broccoliTurnipRadishHorseradishSome medicines may interfere with the test. These include vitamin C, aspirin, and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Ask your provider if you need to stop taking these before the test. Never stop or change your medicine without first talking to your provider.How the Test will Feel

The at-home test involves a normal bowel movement. There is no discomfort. You may have some discomfort if the stool is collected during a rectal exam.Why the Test is Performed

This test detects blood in the digestive tract. It may be done if:You are being screened or tested for colon cancer.You have abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, or weight loss.You have anemia (low blood count).You say you have blood in the stool or black, tarry stools.Normal Results

A negative test result means that there is no blood in the stool. Occasionally, this test will miss very small amounts of blood in the stool that is below the level of detection of this test (false negative).What Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal results may be due to problems that cause bleeding in the stomach or intestinal tract, including:Colon cancer or other gastrointestinalÂ tumorsColon polypsBleeding veins in the esophagus or stomach (esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy)Inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis)Inflammation of the stomach (gastritis)HemorrhoidsCrohn disease or ulcerative colitisPeptic ulcerOther causes of a positive test may include:NosebleedCoughing up blood and then swallowing it If the stool guaiac results come back positive for blood in the stool, your doctor will likely order other tests, often including a colonoscopy.The stool guaiac test does not diagnose cancer. Screening tests such as colonoscopy can help detect cancer. The stool guaiac test and other screenings can catch colon cancer early, when it is easier to treat.Risks

There can be false-positive and false-negative results. Errors are reduced when you follow instructions during collection and avoid certain foods and medicines. Alternative Names

 Injury to the kidney and ureter is damage to the organs of the upper urinary tract.Causes

The kidneys are located in the flank at either side of the spine. The flank is the back of the upper abdomen. They are protected by the spine, lower rib cage, and strong muscles of the back. This location protects the kidneys from many outside forces. The kidneys are also surrounded by a layer of fat. The fat helps to cushion them.The kidneys have a large blood supply. Any injury to them, can lead to severe bleeding. The many layers of padding help prevent kidney injury.Kidneys may be injured by damage to the blood vessels that supply or drain them, including:AneurysmArterial blockageArteriovenous fistulaRenal vein thrombosis (clotting)Trauma Kidney injuries may also be caused by:Angiomyolipoma, a noncancerous tumor, if the tumor is very largeAutoimmune disordersBladder outlet obstructionCancer of the kidney, pelvic organs (ovaries or uterus in women), or colonDiabetesBuildup of body waste products such as uric acid (which can occur with gout or treatment of bone marrow, lymph node, or other disorders)Exposure to toxic substances such as lead, cleaning products, solvents, fuels, certain antibiotics, or long-term use of pain medicines (analgesic nephropathy)High blood pressure and other medical conditions that affect the kidneysInflammation caused by immune responses to medicines, infection, or other disordersMedical procedures such as kidney biopsy, or nephrostomy tube placementUreteropelvic junction obstructionUreteral obstructionKidney stones The ureters are the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteral injuries may be caused by:Complications from medical proceduresDiseases such as retroperitoneal fibrosis, retroperitoneal sarcomas, or cancers that spread to the lymph nodes near the uretersKidney stone diseaseRadiation to the belly areaTrauma Symptoms

Emergency symptoms may include:Abdominal pain and swellingSevere flank pain and back painBlood in the urineDrowsiness, decreased alertness, including comaDecreased urine output or inability to urinateFeverIncreased heart rateNausea, vomitingSkin that is pale or cool to touchSweating Long-term (chronic) symptoms may include:MalnutritionHigh blood pressureKidney failure If only one kidney is affected and the other kidney is healthy, you may not have any symptoms.Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you. Let them know about any recent illness or if you have come into contact with toxic substances.The exam may show:Excess bleeding (hemorrhage)Extreme tenderness over the kidneyShock, including rapid heart rate or falling blood pressureSigns of kidney failure Tests that may be done include:Abdominal CT scanAbdominal MRIAbdominal ultrasoundAngiography of the kidney artery or veinBlood electrolytesBlood tests to look for toxic substancesComplete blood count (CBC)Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)Kidney function testsKidney x-rayRetrograde pyelogramRenal scanUrinalysisUrodynamic studyVoiding cystourethrogramTreatment

The goals are to treat emergency symptoms and prevent or treat complications. You may need to stay in a hospital.Treatments for a kidney injury may include:Bed rest for 1 to 2 weeks or until bleeding is reducedClose observation and treatment for symptoms of kidney failureDiet changesMedicines to treat damage caused by toxic substances or illnesses (for example, chelation therapy for lead poisoning or allopurinol to lower uric acid in the blood due to gout)Pain medicinesEliminating medicines or exposure to substances that may have injured the kidneyDrugs such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants if the injury was caused by inflammationTreatment of acute kidney failureSometimes, surgery is needed. This may include:Repairing a "fractured" or torn kidney, torn blood vessels, torn ureter, or similar injuryRemoving the entire kidney (nephrectomy), draining the space around the kidney, or stopping the bleeding via arterial catheterization (angioembolization)Placing a stentRemoving blockage or relieving obstructionOutlook (Prognosis)

How well you do depends on the cause and severity of the injury. Sometimes, the kidney starts working properly again. Sometimes, kidney failure occurs. Possible Complications

Complications may include:Sudden kidney failure, one or both kidneysBleeding (may be minor or severe)Bruising of the kidneyChronic kidney failure, one or both kidneysInfection (peritonitis, sepsis)PainRenal artery stenosisRenal hypertensionShockUrinary tract infectionWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of an injury to the kidney or ureter. Contact the provider if you have a history of:Exposure to toxic substancesIllnessInfectionPhysical injuryGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have decreased urine output after a kidney injury. This may be a symptom of kidney failure.Prevention

You can help prevent injury to the kidneys and ureter by taking these steps:Be aware of substances that can cause lead poisoning. These include old paints, vapors from working with lead-coated metals, and alcohol distilled in recycled car radiators.Take all your medicines properly, including ones you buy without a prescription (over-the-counter).Treat gout and other illnesses as instructed by your provider.Use safety equipment during work and play.Use cleaning products, solvents, and fuels as directed. Make sure the area is well-ventilated, because the fumes may also be toxic.Wear seat belts and drive safely.Alternative Names

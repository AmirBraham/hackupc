 Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is a low red blood cell count due to a lack (deficiency) of vitamin B12.Causes

Your body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. In order to provide vitamin B12 to your cells:You must eat foods that contain vitamin B12, such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, fortified breakfast cereals, and dairy products.Your body must absorb enough vitamin B12. A special protein, called intrinsic factor, helps your body do this. This protein is released by cells in the stomach. A lack of vitamin B12 may be due to dietary factors, including:Eating a strict vegetarian dietPoor diet in infantsPoor nutrition during pregnancy Certain health conditions can make it difficult for your body to absorb enough vitamin B12. They include:Alcohol useCrohn disease, celiac disease, infection with the fish tapeworm, or other problems that make it difficult for your body to digest foodsPernicious anemia, a type of vitamin B12 anemia that occurs when your body destroys cells that make intrinsic factorSurgery that removes certain parts of your stomach or small intestine, such as some weight-loss surgeriesTaking antacids and other heartburn medicines for a long period of timeAbuse of "laughing gas" (nitrous oxide) Symptoms

You may not have symptoms. Symptoms may be mild. Symptoms can include: Diarrhea or constipationFatigue, lack of energy, or lightheadedness when standing up or with exertionLoss of appetitePale skinFeeling irritableShortness of breath, mostly during exerciseSwollen, red tongue or bleeding gums If you have low vitamin B12 level for a long time, you can have nerve damage. Symptoms of nerve damage include: Confusion or change in mental status (dementia) in severe casesProblems concentratingPsychosis (losing contact with reality)Loss of balanceNumbness and tingling of hands and feetHallucinationsExams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal problems with your reflexes. Tests that may be done include: Complete blood count (CBC)Reticulocyte countLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levelSerum bilirubin levelVitamin B12 levelMethylmalonic acid (MMA) levelSerum homocysteine level (amino acid found in blood)Other procedures that may be done include:Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to examine the stomach and small intestineBone marrow biopsy if the diagnosis is not clear Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause of B12 deficiency anemia. The goal of treatment is to increase your vitamin B12 level.Treatment may include a shot of vitamin B12 once a month. If you have a very low level of B12, you may need more shots in the beginning. It is possible you may need shots every month for the rest of your life.Some people may respond to treatment by taking vitamin B12 supplements by mouth. Your provider will also recommend that you eat a variety of foods.Outlook (Prognosis)

People with this type of anemia often do well with treatment.Long-term vitamin B12 deficiency can cause nerve damage. This may be permanent if you do not start treatment within 6 months of when your symptoms begin.Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia most often responds well to treatment. It will likely get better when the underlying cause of the deficiency is treated. Possible Complications

A woman with a low B12 level may have a false positive Pap smear. This is because vitamin B12 deficiency affects the way certain cells (epithelial cells) in the cervix look.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Vulvar cancer is cancer that starts in the vulva. Vulvar cancer most often affects the labia, the folds of skin outside the vagina. In some cases, vulvar cancer starts on the clitoris or in glands on the sides of the vaginal opening. Causes

Most vulvar cancers begin in skin cells called squamous cells. Other types of cancers found on the vulva are:AdenocarcinomaBasal cell carcinomaMelanomaSarcoma Vulvar cancer is rare. Risk factors include:Human papilloma virus (HPV, or genital warts) infection in women under age 50Chronic skin changes, such as lichen sclerosis or squamous hyperplasia in women over age 50History of cervical cancer or vaginal cancerSmoking Women with a condition called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) may develop into a vulvar cancer that spreads. Most cases of VIN, though, never lead to cancer.Other possible risk factors may include:History of abnormal Pap smearsHaving many sexual partnersHaving first sexual intercourse at 16 or younger Symptoms

Women with this condition will often have itching around the vagina for years. They may have used different skin creams. They may also have bleeding or discharge outside their periods.Other skin changes that may occur around the vulva:Mole or freckle, which may be pink, red, white, or graySkin thickening or lumpSkin sore (ulcer) especially if non healingOther symptoms:Pain or burning with urinationPain with intercourseUnusual odor Some women with vulvar cancer have no symptoms.Exams and Tests

The following tests are used to diagnose vulvar cancer:BiopsyCT scan or MRI of the pelvis to look for cancer spreadPelvic examination to look for any skin changesPositron emission tomography (PET) scanColposcopyTreatment

Treatment involves surgery to remove the cancer cells. If the tumor is large (more than 2 cm) or has grown into the skin, the lymph nodes in the groin area may also be removed.Radiation, with or without chemotherapy, may be used to treat:Advanced tumors that cannot be treated with surgeryVulvar cancer that comes backWomen who are not medically able to undergo surgerySupport Groups

You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most women with vulvar cancer who are diagnosed and treated at an early stage do well. But a woman's outcome depends on:The size of the tumorThe type of vulvar cancerWhether the cancer has spread The cancer commonly comes back at or near the site of the original tumor.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Spread of the cancer to other areas of the bodySide effects of radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms for more than 2 weeks:Local irritationSkin color changeSore on the vulva Prevention

Practicing safer sex may decrease your risk for vulvar cancer. This includes using condoms to protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).A vaccine is available to protect against certain forms of HPV infection. The vaccine is approved to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts. It may help prevent other cancers linked to HPV, such as vulvar cancer. The vaccine is given to young girls before they become sexually active, and to adolescents and women up to age 45.Routine pelvic exams can help detect vulvar cancer at an earlier stage. Earlier diagnosis improves your chances that treatment will be successful.Alternative Names

 Pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space. The pleural space is the area between the layers of the tissue lining the lung and the chest cavity.In a person with parapneumonic pleural effusion, the fluid buildup is caused by pneumonia.Causes

Pneumonia, most commonly from bacteria, causes parapneumonic pleural effusion.Symptoms

Symptoms can include any of the following:Chest pain, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breathsCough with sputumFeverRapid breathingShortness of breathExams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The provider will also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and tap (percuss) your chest and upper back.The following tests may help to confirm a diagnosis:Complete blood count (CBC) blood testChest CT scanChest x-rayThoracentesis (a sample of fluid is removed with a needle inserted between the ribs)Ultrasound of the chest and heartTreatment

Antibiotics are prescribed to treat the pneumonia.If the person has shortness of breath, thoracentesis might be used to drain the fluid. If better drainage of the fluid is needed due to more severe infection, a drain tube can be inserted.Outlook (Prognosis)

This condition improves when the pneumonia improves.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Lung damageInfection that turns into an abscess, called an empyema, which will need to be drained with a chest tubeCollapsed lung (pneumothorax) after thoracentesisScarring of the pleural space (lining of the lung) When to Contact a Medical Professional

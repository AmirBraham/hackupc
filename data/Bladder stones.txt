 Bladder stones are hard buildups of minerals. These form in the urinary bladder.Causes

Bladder stones are most often caused by another urinary system problem, such as:
  Bladder diverticulum
  Blockage at the base of the bladderEnlarged prostate (BPH)Neurogenic bladderUrinary tract infection (UTI)Incomplete emptying of the bladderForeign objects in the bladderAlmost all bladder stones occur in men. Bladder stones are much less common than kidney stones.Bladder stones may occur when urine in the bladder is concentrated. Materials in the urine form crystals. These may also result from foreign objects in the bladder.Symptoms

Symptoms occur when the stone irritates the lining of the bladder. The stones may also block the flow of urine from the bladder. Symptoms can include:Abdominal pain, pressureAbnormally colored or dark-colored urineBlood in the urineDifficulty urinatingFrequent urge to urinateInability to urinate except in certain positionsInterruption of the urine streamPain, discomfort in the penisSigns of UTI (such as fever, pain when urinating, and need to urinate often)Loss of urine control may also occur with bladder stones.Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This will also include a rectal exam. The exam may reveal an enlarged prostate in men or other problems.The following tests may be done:
   Bladder or pelvis x-ray
   CystoscopyUrinalysisUrine culture (clean catch) Abdominal ultrasound or CT scanTreatment

You may be able to help small stones pass on their own. Drinking 6 to 8 glasses of water or more per day will increase urination.Your provider may remove stones that do not pass using a cystoscope. A small telescope will be passed through the urethra into the bladder. A laser or other device will be used to break up the stones and the pieces will be removed. Some stones may need to be removed using open surgery.Drugs are rarely used to dissolve the stones.Causes of bladder stones should be treated. Most commonly, bladder stones are seen with BPH or blockage at the base of the bladder. You may need surgery to remove the inside part of the prostate or to repair the bladder.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most bladder stones pass on their own or can be removed. They do not cause permanent damage to the bladder. They may come back if the cause is not corrected.Left untreated, stones may cause repeated UTIs. This can also cause permanent damage to the bladder or kidneys.When to Contact a Medical Professional

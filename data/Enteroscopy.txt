 Enteroscopy is a procedure used to examine the small intestine (small bowel).How the Test is Performed

A thin, flexible tube (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and into the upper gastrointestinal tract. During a double-balloon enteroscopy, balloons attached to the endoscope can be inflated to allow the doctor to view a section of the small intestine.In a colonoscopy, a flexible tube is inserted through your rectum and colon. The tube can most often reach into the end part of the small intestine (ileum). Capsule endoscopy is done with a disposable capsule that you swallow.Tissue samples removed during enteroscopy are sent to the lab for examination. (Biopsies cannot be taken with a capsule endoscopy.)How to Prepare for the Test

Do not take products containing aspirin for 1 week before the procedure. Tell your health care provider if you take blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or apixaban (Eliquis) because these may interfere with the test. Do not stop taking any medicine unless told to do so by your provider.Do not eat any solid foods or milk products after midnight the day of your procedure. You may have clear liquids until 4 hours before your exam.You must sign a consent form.How the Test will Feel

You will be given calming and sedating medicine for the procedure and will not feel any discomfort. You may have some bloating or cramping when you wake up. This is from air that is pumped into the abdomen to expand the area during the procedure.A capsule endoscopy causes no discomfort.Why the Test is Performed

This test is most often performed to help diagnose diseases of the small intestines. It may be done if you have:Abnormal x-ray resultsTumors in the small intestinesUnexplained diarrheaUnexplained gastrointestinal bleedingNormal Results

In a normal test result, the provider will not find sources of bleeding in the small bowel, and will not find any tumors or other abnormal tissue.What Abnormal Results Mean

Signs may include:Abnormalities of the tissue lining the small intestine (mucosa) or the tiny, finger-like projections on the surface of the small intestine (villi)Abnormal lengthening of blood vessels (angioectasis) in the intestinal liningImmune cells called PAS-positive macrophagesPolyps or cancerRadiation enteritisSwollen or enlarged lymph nodes or lymphatic vesselsUlcersChanges found on enteroscopy may be signs of disorders and conditions, including:AmyloidosisCeliac sprueCrohn diseaseFolate or vitamin B12 deficiencyGiardiasisInfectious gastroenteritisLymphangiectasiaLymphomaSmall intestinal angiectasiaSmall intestinal cancerTropical sprueWhipple diseaseRisks

Complications are rare but may include:Excessive bleeding from the biopsy siteHole in the bowel (bowel perforation)Infection of the biopsy site leading to bacteremiaVomiting, followed by aspiration into the lungsThe capsule endoscope can cause a blockage in a narrowed intestine with symptoms of abdominal pain and bloatingConsiderations

Factors that prohibit use of this test may include:
   Uncooperative or confused person
   
   Untreated blood clotting (coagulation) disorders
   
   Use of aspirin or other medicines that prevent the blood from clotting normally (anticoagulants)
   The greatest risk is bleeding. Signs include:Abdominal painBlood in the stoolsVomiting bloodAlternative Names

 Retropharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the tissues in the back of the throat. It can be a life-threatening medical condition.Causes

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and look inside the throat. The provider may gently rub the back of the throat with a cotton swab. This is to take a sample of tissue to check it more closely. It is called a throat culture.Other tests may include:Complete blood count (CBC)CT scan of the neckX-ray of the neck Fiber optic endoscopyTreatment

Surgery is needed to drain the infected area. Corticosteroids are sometimes given to reduce airway swelling. High-dose antibiotics are given through a vein (intravenous) to treat the infection.The airway will be protected so that it does not become completely blocked by the swelling.Outlook (Prognosis)

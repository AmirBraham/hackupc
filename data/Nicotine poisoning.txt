 Nicotine is a bitter-tasting compound that naturally occurs in large amounts in the leaves of tobacco plants.Nicotine poisoning results from taking too much nicotine. Acute nicotine poisoning usually occurs in young children who accidentally chew on nicotine gum or patches.Â Nicotine is rapidly absorbed after ingestion and inhalation. In young children, ingestion of 1 to 2 mg of nicotine has been associated with signs of toxicity (poisoning).This article is for information only.

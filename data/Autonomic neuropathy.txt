 Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms that occur when there is damage to the nerves that manage normally automatic body functions. These functions include blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion.Causes

Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms. It is not a specific disease. There are many causes.Autonomic neuropathy involves damage to the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord. The information is then carried to the heart, blood vessels, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, and pupils.Autonomic neuropathy may be seen with:Alcohol abuseDiabetes (diabetic neuropathy)Disorders involving scarring of tissues around the nervesGuillain Barr√© syndrome or other diseases that inflame nervesHIV/AIDSInherited nerve disordersMultiple sclerosisParkinson diseaseSpinal cord injurySurgery or injury involving the nerves Symptoms

Symptoms vary, depending on the nerves affected. They usually develop slowly over years. Stomach and intestine symptoms may include:Constipation (hard stools)Diarrhea (loose stools)Feeling full after only a few bites (early satiety)Nausea after eatingProblems controlling bowel movementsSwallowing problemsSwollen abdomenVomiting of undigested food Heart and lungs symptoms may include:Abnormal heart rate or rhythmBlood pressure drop with position that causes dizziness when standingHigh blood pressureShortness of breath with activity or exercise Bladder symptoms may include:Difficulty beginning to urinateFeeling of incomplete bladder emptyingLeaking urine Other symptoms may include:Sweating too much or not enoughHeat intolerance brought on with activity and exerciseSexual problems, including erection problems in men and vaginal dryness and orgasm difficulties in womenSmall pupil in one eyeWeight loss without trying Exams and Tests

Signs of autonomic nerve damage are not always seen when your doctor examines you. Your blood pressure or heart rate may change when lying down, sitting, or standing. Special tests to measure sweating and heart rate may be done. This is called autonomic testing.Other tests depend on what type of symptoms you have. Treatment

Treatment to reverse nerve damage is most often not possible. As a result, treatment and self-care are focused on managing your symptoms and preventing further problems.Your health care provider may recommend: Extra salt in the diet or taking salt tablets to increase fluid volume in blood vesselsFludrocortisone or similar medicines to help your body retain salt and fluidMedicines to treat irregular heart rhythmsPacemakerSleeping with the head raisedWearing compression stockingsThe following may help your intestines and stomach work better:Daily bowel care programMedicines that help the stomach move food through fasterSleeping with the head raisedSmall, frequent meals Medicines and self-care programs can help you if you have: Urinary incontinenceNeurogenic bladderErection problems Outlook (Prognosis)

How well you do will depend on the cause of the problem and if it can be treated. When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. Early symptoms might include:Becoming faint or lightheaded when standingChanges in bowel, bladder, or sexual functionUnexplained nausea and vomiting when eating Early diagnosis and treatment may control symptoms.Autonomic neuropathy may hide the warning signs of a heart attack. Instead of feeling chest pain, if you have autonomic neuropathy, during a heart attack you may only have:Sudden fatigueSweatingShortness of breathNausea and vomitingPrevention

Prevent or control associated disorders to reduce the risk for neuropathy. For example, people with diabetes should closely control blood sugar levels. Alternative Names

 Agitation is an unpleasant state of extreme arousal. An agitated person may feel stirred up, excited, tense, confused, or irritable.Considerations

Agitation can come on suddenly or over time. It can last for a few minutes, for weeks, or even months. Pain, stress, and fever can all increase agitation.Agitation by itself may not be a sign of a health problem. But if other symptoms occur, it can be a sign of disease.Agitation with a change in alertness (altered consciousness) can be a sign of delirium. Delirium has a medical cause and should be checked by a health care provider right away.Causes

There are many causes of agitation. Some of them are:Alcohol intoxication or withdrawalAllergic reactionCaffeine intoxicationCertain forms of heart, lung, liver, or kidney diseaseIntoxication or withdrawal from drugs of abuse (such as cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens, PCP, or opiods)Hospitalization (older adults often have delirium while in the hospital)
   Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)Infection (especially in elderly people)Nicotine withdrawalPoisoning (for example, carbon monoxide poisoning)Some medicines, including theophylline, amphetamines, and steroidsTraumaVitamin B6 deficiency Agitation can occur with brain and mental health disorders, such as:AnxietyDementia (such as Alzheimer disease)DepressionManiaSchizophreniaHome Care

The most important way to deal with agitation is to find and treat the cause. Agitation may lead to an increased risk of suicide and other forms of violence.After treating the cause, the following measures can reduce agitation:
   A calm environment
   
   Enough lighting during the day and darkness at night
   
   Medicines such as benzodiazepines, and in some cases, antipsychotics
   
   Plenty of sleep
   DO NOT physically hold back an agitated person, if possible. This usually makes the problem worse. Use restraints only if the person is at risk of harming themselves or others, and there is no other way to control the behavior.When to Contact a Medical Professional

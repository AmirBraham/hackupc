Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways. LOCAL PHARMACIES The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large "chain" store. It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions. Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies.

The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy. INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.

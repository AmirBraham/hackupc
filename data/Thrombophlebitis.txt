 Thrombophlebitis is swelling (inflammation) of a vein. A blood clot (thrombus) in the vein is the most common cause of this swelling.Causes

Thrombophlebitis may affect deeper, larger veins or veins near the skin surface. Most of the time, it occurs in the pelvis and legs.Blood clots may form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins. Risk factors include:A pacemaker catheter that has been passed through the vein in the groinBed rest or sitting in one position for too long, such as plane travelFamily history of blood clots, which may imply the presence of inherited disorders that lead to increased risk of clots. Common ones include deficiency or lack of antithrombin 3, protein C, and protein S, factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin abnormalitiesFractures in the pelvis or legsGiving birth within the last 6 monthsPregnancyObesityRecent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery)Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal (polycythemia vera)Having an indwelling (long-term) catheter in a blood vesselBlood is more likely to clot in someone who has certain problems or disorders, such as:CancerCertain autoimmune disorders, such as lupusCigarette smokingConditions that make it more likely to develop blood clotsTaking estrogens or birth control pills (this risk is even higher with smoking)Symptoms

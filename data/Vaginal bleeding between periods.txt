 This article discusses vaginal bleeding that occurs between a woman's monthly menstrual periods. Such bleeding may be called "intermenstrual bleeding."Related topics include:Dysfunctional uterine bleedingHeavy, prolonged, or irregular menstrual periods Considerations

Normal menstrual flow lasts about 5 days. It produces a total blood loss of 30 to 80 mL (about 2 to 8 tablespoons), and occurs normally every 21 to 35 days.Vaginal bleeding that occurs between periods or after menopause can be caused by various problems. Most are benign and can be easily treated. Sometimes, vaginal bleeding may be due to cancer or pre-cancer. Therefore, any unusual bleeding should be evaluated right away. The risk for cancer increases to about 10% in women with postmenopausal bleeding.Make sure that bleeding is coming from the vagina and is not from the rectum or the urine. Inserting a tampon into the vagina will confirm the vagina, cervix, or uterus as the source of bleeding.A careful exam by your health care provider is most often the best way to find the source of the bleeding. This exam can be done even while you are bleeding.Causes

Causes may include:Uterine fibroids or cervical or uterine polypsChanges in hormone levelsInflammation or infection of the cervix (cervicitis) or uterus (endometritis)Injury or disease of the vaginal opening (caused by intercourse, trauma, infection, polyp, genital warts, ulcer, or varicose veins)IUD use (may cause occasional spotting)Ectopic pregnancyMiscarriageOther pregnancy complicationsVaginal dryness due to lack of estrogen after menopauseStressUsing hormonal birth control irregularly (such as stopping and starting or skipping birth control pills, patches, or estrogen rings) Underactive thyroid (low thyroid function)Use of blood thinners (anticoagulants)Cancer or pre-cancer of the cervix, uterus, or (very rarely) fallopian tubePelvic exam, cervical biopsy, endometrial biopsy, or other procedures Home Care

Contact a provider right away if bleeding is very heavy.Keep track of the number of pads or tampons used over time so that the amount of bleeding can be determined. Uterine blood loss can be estimated by keeping track of how frequently a pad or tampon is soaked and how often one needs to be changed.If possible, aspirin should be avoided, as it may prolong bleeding. However, NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as ibuprofen can be used to minimize bleeding and cramping.When to Contact a Medical Professional

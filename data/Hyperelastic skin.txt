 Hyperelastic skin is skin that can be stretched beyond what is considered normal. The skin returns to normal after it is stretched.Considerations

Hyperelasticity occurs when there is a problem with how the body makes collagen or elastin fibers. These are types of proteins that makes up much of the body's tissue.Causes

Hyperelastic skin is most often seen in people who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. People with this disorder have very elastic skin. They also have joints that can be bent more than is normally possible. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as rubber men or women.Other conditions that may cause skin that is easily stretched include:Marfan syndrome (genetic disorder of human connective tissue)Osteogenesis imperfecta (congenital bone disorder characterized by brittle bones)Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (rare genetic disorder that causes fragmentation and mineralization of elastic fibers in some tissues)Subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma (type of lymph system cancer that involves the skin)Sun-related changes of older skin Home Care

You need to take special steps to avoid skin damage when you have this condition because your skin is more delicate than normal. You are more likely to get cuts and scrapes, and scars may stretch and become more visible.Talk to your health care provider about what you can do for this problem. Get skin check-ups often.If you need surgery, discuss with your provider how the wound will be dressed and cared for after the procedure.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 The methylene blue test is a test to determine the type or to treatÂ methemoglobinemia, a blood disorder. How the Test is Performed

The health care provider wraps a tight band or blood pressure cuff around your upper arm. The pressure causes veins below the area to fill with blood.The arm is cleaned with a germ killer (antiseptic). A needle is placed into your vein, usually near the inside of the elbow or back of the hand. A thin tube, called a catheter, is placed into the vein. (This may be called an IV, which means intravenous). While the tube stays in place, the needle and tourniquet are removed.A dark green powder called methylene blue goes through the tube into your vein. The provider looks at how the powder turns a substance in the blood called methemoglobin into normal hemoglobin.How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is required for this test.How the Test will Feel

When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.Why the Test is Performed

There are several types of oxygen-carrying proteins in the blood. One of them is methemoglobin. Normal methemoglobin levels in blood are usually 1%. If the level is higher, you can become sick because the protein is not carrying oxygen. This can make your blood look brown instead of red. Methemoglobinemia has several causes, many of which are genetic (problem with your genes). This test is used to tell the difference between methemoglobinemia caused by the lack of a protein called cytochrome b5 reductase and other types that are passed down through families (inherited). Your doctor will use the results of this test to help determine your treatment.Normal Results

Normally, methylene blue quickly lowers the level of methemoglobin in the blood.Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.What Abnormal Results Mean

You may have a rare form of methemoglobinemia if this test does not significantly lower the blood level of methemoglobin.Risks

There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Inserting an IV may be more difficult for you or your child than for other people.Other risks associated with this type of blood test are minor, but may include:Excessive bleedingFainting or feeling lightheadedMultiple punctures to locate veinsHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin causing bruising)Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken, but the chances of infection increase the longer the IV remains in the vein) Alternative Names

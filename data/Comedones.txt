 Comedones are small, flesh-colored, white, or dark bumps that give skin a rough texture. The bumps are one type of acne. They are found at the opening of skin pores. A solid core can often be seen in the middle of the small bump. Comedones are called open or closed based on whether the surface is disrupted (open) or intact (closed). Open comedones are blackheads and closed comedones are whiteheads.Alternative Names

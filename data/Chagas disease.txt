 Chagas disease is an illness caused by tiny parasites and spread by insects. The disease is common in South and Central America.Causes

Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is spread by the bite of reduviid bugs, or kissing bugs, and is one of the major health problems in South America. Due to immigration, the disease also affects people in the United States.Risk factors for Chagas disease include:Living in a hut where reduviid bugs live in the wallsLiving in Central or South AmericaPovertyReceiving a blood transfusion or an organ donation from a person who carries the parasite, but does not have active Chagas diseaseSymptoms

Chagas disease has two phases: acute and chronic. The acute phase may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms, including:FeverGeneral ill feelingSwelling of an eye if the bite is near the eyeSwollen red area at site of the insect biteAfter the acute phase, the disease goes into remission. No other symptoms may appear for many years. When symptoms finally develop, they may include:
   Constipation
   Digestive problemsHeart failurePain in the abdomenPounding or racing heartSwallowing difficultiesExams and Tests

Physical examination can confirm the symptoms. Signs of Chagas disease may include:Disease of the heart muscleEnlarged liver and spleenEnlarged lymph nodesIrregular heartbeatRapid heartbeat Tests include:Blood culture to look for signs of infectionChest x-rayEchocardiogram (uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart)Electrocardiogram (ECG, tests electrical activity in the heart)Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) to look for signs of infectionBlood smear to look for signs of infection Treatment

The acute phase of reactivated Chagas disease should be treated. Infants born with the infection should also be treated.Treating the chronic phase is recommended for children and most adults. Adults with chronic phase Chagas disease should talk to their health care provider to decide whether treatment is needed.Two drugs are used to treat this infection: benznidazole and nifurtimox.Both drugs often have side effects. The side effects may be worse in older people. They may include:Headaches and dizzinessLoss of appetite and weight lossNerve damageProblems sleepingSkin rashesOutlook (Prognosis)

About one third of infected people who are not treated will develop chronic or symptomatic Chagas disease. It may take more than 20 years from the time of the original infection to develop heart or digestive problems.Abnormal heart rhythms may cause sudden death. Once heart failure develops, death usually occurs within several years.Possible Complications

Chagas disease can cause these complications:Enlarged colonEnlarged esophagus with swallowing difficulty
   Heart disease
   Heart failureMalnutritionWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider for an appointment if you think you may have Chagas disease.Prevention

Insect control with insecticides and houses that are less likely to have high insect populations will help control the spread of the disease.Blood banks in Central and South America screen donors for exposure to the parasite. The blood is discarded if the donor has the parasite. Most blood banks in the United States began screening for Chagas disease in 2007.Alternative Names

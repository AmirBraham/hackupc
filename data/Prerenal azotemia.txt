 Prerenal azotemia is an abnormally high level of nitrogen waste products in the blood.Causes

Prerenal azotemia is common, especially in older adults and in people who are in the hospital.The kidneys filter the blood. They also make urine to remove waste products. When the amount, or pressure, of blood flow through the kidney drops, filtering of the blood also drops. Or it may not occur at all. Waste products stay in the blood. Little or no urine is made, even though the kidney itself is working.When nitrogen waste products, such as creatinine and urea, build up in the body, the condition is called azotemia. These waste products act as poisons when they build up. They damage tissues and reduce the ability of the organs to function.Prerenal azotemia is the most common form of kidney failure in hospitalized people. Any condition that reduces blood flow to the kidney may cause it, including:BurnsConditions that allow fluid to escape from the bloodstreamLong-term vomiting, diarrhea, or bleedingHeat exposureDecreased fluid intake (dehydration)Loss of blood volumeCertain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that treat heart failure or high blood pressure) and NSAIDsConditions in which the heart cannot pump enough blood or pumps blood at a low volume also increase the risk for prerenal azotemia. These conditions include:Heart failureShock (septic shock) It can also be caused by conditions that interrupt blood flow to the kidney, such as:Certain types of surgeryInjury to the kidneyBlockage of the artery that supplies blood to the kidney (renal artery occlusion) Symptoms

Prerenal azotemia may have no symptoms. Or, symptoms of the causes of prerenal azotemia may be present.Symptoms of dehydration may be present and include any of the following:ConfusionDecreased or no urine productionDry mouth due to thirstFast pulseFatiguePale skin colorSwellingExams and Tests

An examination may show:Collapsed neck veinsDry mucous membranesLittle or no urine in the bladderLow blood pressureLow heart function or hypovolemiaPoor skin elasticity (turgor)Rapid heart rateReduced pulse pressureSigns of acute kidney failureThe following tests may be done:Blood creatinineBUNUrine osmolality and specific gravityUrine tests to check sodium and creatinine levels and to monitor kidney function Treatment

The main goal of treatment is to quickly correct the cause before the kidney becomes damaged. PeopleÂ often need to stay in the hospital. Intravenous (IV) fluids, including blood or blood products, may be used to increase blood volume. After blood volume has been restored, medicines may be used to: Increase blood pressureImprove the pumping of the heart If the person has symptoms of acute kidney failure, treatment will likely include:DialysisDiet changesMedicines Outlook (Prognosis)

Prerenal azotemia can be reversed if the cause can be found and corrected within 24 hours. If the cause is not fixed quickly, damage may occur to the kidney (acute tubular necrosis).Possible Complications

Complications may include:Acute kidney failureAcute tubular necrosis (tissue death) When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of prerenal azotemia.Prevention

Quickly treating any condition that reduces the volume or force of blood flow through the kidneys may help prevent prerenal azotemia.Alternative Names

Azotemia - prerenal; Uremia; Renal underperfusion; Acute renal failure - prerenal azotemiaImages

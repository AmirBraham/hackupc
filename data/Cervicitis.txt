Cervicitis is most often caused by an infection that is caught during sexual activity. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can cause cervicitis include:ChlamydiaGonorrheaHerpes virus (genital herpes)Human papilloma virus (genital warts)TrichomoniasisOther things that can cause cervicitis include:A device inserted into the pelvic area such as a cervical cap, diaphragm, IUD, or pessaryAllergy to spermicides used for birth controlAllergy to latex in condomsExposure to a chemical Reaction to douches or vaginal deodorantsCervicitis is very common. It affects more than one half of all women at some point during their adult life. Causes include:High-risk sexual behaviorHistory of STIsMany sexual partnersSex (intercourse) at an early ageSexual partners who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI Too much growth of some bacteria that normally are present in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) can also lead to cervical infection.Symptoms

If symptoms are present, these may include:Abnormal vaginal bleeding that occurs after intercourse, or between periodsUnusual vaginal discharge that does not go away: discharge may be gray, white or yellow in colorPainful sexual intercoursePain in the vaginaPressure or heaviness in the pelvisPainful urinationVaginal itchingWomen who may be at risk for chlamydia should be tested for this infection, even if they do not have symptoms.Exams and Tests

Antibiotics are used to treat chlamydia or gonorrhea. Medicines called antivirals may be used to treat herpes infections.Hormonal therapy (with estrogen or progesterone) may be used in women who have reached menopause.Outlook (Prognosis)

Most of the time, simple cervicitis usually heals with treatment if the cause is found and there is a treatment for that cause.Most of the time, cervicitis does not cause any symptoms. It doesn't need treatment as long as tests for bacterial and viral causes are negative.Possible Complications

Cervicitis may last for months to years. Cervicitis may lead to pain with intercourse.Untreated cervicitis may lead to inflammation involving the female pelvic organs, causing a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).When to Contact a Medical Professional

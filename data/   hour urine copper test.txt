A 24-hour urine sample is needed.On day 1, urinate into the toilet when you get up in the morning.Afterward, collect all urine in a special container for the next 24 hours.On day 2, urinate into the container when you get up in the morning.Cap the container. Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.Label the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.For an infant, thoroughly wash the area where urine exits the body.Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.For females, place the bag over the labia.Diaper as usual over the secured bag.This procedure may take more than one try. An active infant can move the bag, so that the urine leaks into the diaper.Check the infant often and change the bag after the infant has urinated into it.Drain the urine from the bag into the container given to you by your health care provider.Return the bag or container as instructed.A laboratory specialist will determine how much copper is in the sample.How to Prepare for the Test

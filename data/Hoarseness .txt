 Hoarseness refers to difficulty making sounds when trying to speak. Vocal sounds may be weak, breathy, scratchy, or husky, and the pitch or quality of the voice may change.Considerations

Hoarseness is most often caused by a problem with the vocal cords. The vocal cords are part of your voice box (larynx) located in the throat. When the vocal cords become inflamed or infected, they swell. This can cause hoarseness.The most common cause of hoarseness is a cold or throat infection, which most often goes away on its own within 2 weeks.A rare but serious cause of hoarseness that does not go away in a few weeks is cancer of the voice box.Causes

Hoarseness may be caused by:Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux)AllergiesBreathing in irritating substancesCancer of the throat or larynxChronic coughingColds or upper respiratory infectionsHeavy smoking or drinking, particularly togetherOveruse or abuse of the voice (as in shouting or singing), which, over time, may cause swelling or growths on the vocal cords called vocal nodulesLess common causes include:Injury or irritation from a breathing tube or bronchoscopyDamage to the nerves and muscles around the voice box (from trauma or surgery)Foreign object in the esophagus or tracheaSwallowing a harsh chemical liquidChanges in the larynx during pubertyThyroid or lung cancerUnderactive thyroid glandImmobility of one or both vocal cords Home Care

Hoarseness may be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). Vocal rest and time may improve hoarseness. Hoarseness that continues for more than 4 weeks should be checked by a health care provider.Things you can do at home to help relieve the problem include:Talk only when you need to until hoarseness goes away.Drink plenty of fluids to help keep your airways moist. (Gargling does not help.)Use a vaporizer to add moisture to the air you breathe.Avoid actions that strain the vocal cords such as whispering, shouting, crying, and singing.Take medicines to reduce stomach acid if hoarseness is due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).Do not use decongestants which can dry out the vocal cords.If you smoke, cut down, or stop at least until hoarseness goes away. When to Contact a Medical Professional

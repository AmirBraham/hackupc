 When abnormal breast tissue develops in males, it is called gynecomastia. It is important to find out if the excess growth is breast tissue and not excess fat tissue (lipomastia).Considerations

The condition may occur in one or both breasts. It begins as a small lump beneath the nipple, which may be tender. One breast may be larger than the other. Over time the lump may become less tender and feel harder.Enlarged breasts in males are usually harmless, but may cause men to avoid wearing certain clothing or to not want to be seen without a shirt. This can cause significant distress, particularly in young men.Some newborns may have breast development along with a milky discharge (galactorrhea). This condition usually lasts for a couple of weeks to months. In rare cases, it may last until the child is 1 year old.Causes

Normal hormone changes are the most common cause of breast development in newborns, boys, and men. There are other causes as well.HORMONE CHANGESBreast enlargement is usually caused by an imbalance of estrogen (female hormone) and testosterone (male hormone). Males have both types of hormones in their body. Changes in the levels of these hormones, or in how the body uses or responds to these hormones, can cause enlarged breasts in males.In newborns, breast growth is caused by being exposed to estrogen from the mother. About one half of boy babies are born with enlarged breasts, called breast buds. They usually go away in 2 to 6 months, but can last longer.In preteens and teens, breast growth is caused by normal hormone changes that occur during puberty. More than one half of boys develop some breast enlargement during puberty. Breast growth often goes away in about 6 months to 2 years.In men, hormone changes due to aging can cause breast growth. This may occur more often in overweight or obese men and in men age 50 and older.HEALTH CONDITIONSCertain health problems can cause breast growth in adult men, including:Chronic liver diseaseKidney failure and dialysisLow testosterone levelObesity (also the most common cause of breast growth due to fat)Rare causes include:Genetic defectsOveractive thyroid or underactive thyroidTumors (including benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called prolactinoma)MEDICINES AND MEDICAL TREATMENTSome medicines and treatments that can cause breast growth in men include:Cancer chemotherapyHormone treatment for prostate cancer, such as flutamide (Proscar), or for enlarged prostate, such as finasteride (Propecia) or bicalutamideRadiation treatment of the testiclesHIV/AIDS medicinesCorticosteroids and anabolic steroidsEstrogen (including those in soy products)Heartburn and ulcer medicines, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or proton pump inhibitorsAnti-anxiety medicines, such as diazepam (Valium)Heart medicines, such as spironolactone (Aldactone), digoxin (Lanoxin), amiodarone, and calcium channel blockersAntifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole (Nizoral)Antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl)Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil)Herbals such as lavender, tea tree oil, and dong quaiOpioids DRUG AND ALCOHOL USEUsing certain substances can cause breast enlargement:AlcoholAmphetaminesHeroinMarijuanaMethadone Gynecomastia has also been linked to exposure to endocrine disrupters.

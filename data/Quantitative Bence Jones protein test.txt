 This test measures the level of abnormal proteins called Bence-Jones proteins in the urine.How the Test is Performed

A clean-catch urine sample is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.The sample is sent to the lab. There are many methods used to detect Bence-Jones proteins. One method, called immunoelectrophoresis, is the most accurate.How the Test will Feel

The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.Why the Test is Performed

Bence-Jones proteins are a part of regular antibodies called light chains. These proteins are not normally in urine. Sometimes, when your body makes too many antibodies, the level of light chains also rises. Bence-Jones proteins are small enough to be filtered out by the kidneys. The proteins then spill into the urine. Your provider may order this test:To diagnose conditions that lead to protein in the urineIf you have a lot of protein in your urineIf you have signs of a blood cancer called multiple myelomaNormal Results

A normal result means no Bence-Jones proteins are found in your urine.What Abnormal Results Mean

Bence-Jones proteins are rarely found in urine. If they are, it is usually associated with multiple myeloma.An abnormal result may also be due to:An abnormal buildup of proteins in tissues and organs (amyloidosis)Blood cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemiaLymph system cancer (lymphoma)Buildup in the blood of a protein called M-protein (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance; MGUS)Chronic renal failureRisks

There are no risks with this test.Alternative Names

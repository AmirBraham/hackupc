 Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare childhood disease. It affects the brain and other parts of the body.Ataxia refers to uncoordinated movements, such as walking. Telangiectasias are enlarged blood vessels (capillaries) just below the surface of the skin. Telangiectasias appear as tiny, red, spider-like blood vessels.Causes

Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited. This means it is passed down through families. It is an autosomal recessive trait. Both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder.The disease results from a variant in the ATM gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. Defects in this gene can lead to abnormal cell death in many sites of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement.Boys and girls are equally affected.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Decreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood that can include ataxic gait (cerebellar ataxia), jerky gait, unsteadiness Decreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10 to 12Delayed walkingDiscoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlightDiscoloration of skin (coffee-with-milk-colored spots)Enlarged blood vessels in skin of nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and kneeEnlarged blood vessels in the whites of the eyesJerky or abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) late in the diseasePremature graying of the hairSeizuresSensitivity to radiation, including x-raysSevere respiratory infections that keep coming back (recurring) Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may show signs of the following:Tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen below normal sizeDecreased to absent deep tendon reflexesDelayed or absent physical and sexual developmentGrowth failureMask-like faceMultiple skin coloring and texture changes Possible tests include:Alpha fetoproteinB and T cell screenCarcinoembryonic antigenGenetic testing to look for changes in the ATM geneGlucose tolerance testSerum immunoglobulin levels (IgE, IgA)X-ray or CT scan to look at the size of the thymus gland Treatment

There is no specific treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia. Treatment is directed at specific symptoms.Support Groups

More information and support for people with ataxia-telangiectasia condition and their families can be found at:Ataxia Telangiectasia Children's Project: www.atcp.orgNational Ataxia Foundation (NAF): www.ataxia.orgOutlook (Prognosis)

Early death is common, but life expectancy varies. Because people with this condition are very sensitive to radiation, they should never be given radiation therapy, and no unnecessary x-rays should be done.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Cancer, such as lymphomaDiabetesKyphosisProgressive movement disorder that leads to wheelchair useScoliosisSevere, recurrent lung infectionsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if your child develops symptoms of this disorder.Prevention

Couples with a family history of this condition who are considering pregnancy may consider genetic counseling.Parents of a child with this disorder may have a slight increased risk for cancer. They should have genetic counseling and increased cancer screenings.Alternative Names

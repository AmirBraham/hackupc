 Kuru is a disease of the nervous system.Causes

Kuru is a very rare disease. It is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue.Kuru is found among people from New Guinea who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. This practice stopped in 1960, but cases of kuru were reported for many years afterward because the disease has a long incubation period. The incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after being exposed to the agent that causes disease.Kuru causes brain and nervous system changes similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Similar diseases appear in cows as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called mad cow disease.The main risk factor for kuru is eating human brain tissue, which can contain the infectious particles.Symptoms

Symptoms of kuru include:Arm and leg painCoordination problems that become severeDifficulty walkingHeadacheSwallowing difficultyTremors and muscle jerks Difficulty swallowing and being unable to feed oneself can lead to malnutrition or starvation.The average incubation period is 10 to 13 years, but incubation period of 50 years or even longer have also been reported.Exams and Tests

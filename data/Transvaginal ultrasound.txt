 Transvaginal ultrasound is a test used to look at a woman's uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervix and pelvic area.Transvaginal means across or through the vagina. The ultrasound probe will be placed inside the vagina during the test.How the Test is Performed

You will lie down on your back on a table with your knees bent. Your feet may be held in stirrups.The ultrasound technician or doctor will introduce a probe into the vagina. It may be mildly uncomfortable, but will not hurt. The probe is covered with a condom and a gel.The probe transmits sound waves and records the reflections of those waves off body structures. The ultrasound machine creates an image of the body part.The image is displayed on the ultrasound machine. In many offices, the patient can see the image also.The provider will gently move the probe around the area to see the pelvic organs.In some cases, a special transvaginal ultrasound method called saline infusion sonography (SIS) may be needed to more clearly view the uterus.How to Prepare for the Test

 Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a condition with episodes of severe muscle weakness. It occurs in people who have high levels of thyroid hormone in their blood. Examples of this include hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis.Causes

This rare condition occurs only in people with high thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis). Men of Asian or Hispanic descent are affected more often. Most people who develop high thyroid hormone levels are not at risk of periodic paralysis.Hypokalemic, or familial, periodic paralysis is a similar disorder. It is an inherited condition and not related to high thyroid levels, but has the same symptoms.Risk factors include a family history of periodic paralysis and hyperthyroidism.Symptoms

Symptoms involve attacks of muscle weakness or paralysis. Between attacks, normal muscle function returns. Attacks often begin after symptoms of hyperthyroidism have developed. Hyperthyroid symptoms may be subtle.The attacks may occur daily to yearly. Episodes of muscle weakness may last for a few hours or several days.The weakness or paralysis:Comes and goesLasts from a few hours up to several days (rare)Occurs more often in the legs than the armsIs most common in the shoulders and hipsIs triggered by heavy, high-carbohydrate, high-salt mealsIs triggered during rest after exerciseOther rare symptoms may include any of the following:Trouble breathingSpeech problemsTrouble swallowingVision changesDuring attacks, you will be alert and can answer questions. Normal strength returns between attacks. With repeat attacks, you may develop muscle weakness.Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:Excessive sweatingFast heart rateFatigueHeadacheHeat intoleranceIncreased appetiteInsomniaHaving bowel movements more oftenFeeling strong heartbeat (palpitations)Tremors of the handWarm, moist skinWeight loss Exams and Tests

The health care provider may suspect TPP based on:
 Abnormal thyroid hormone levelsA family history of the disorder
 Low potassium level during attacks
 Symptoms that come and goDiagnosis involves ruling out disorders caused by low potassium.Your provider may try to trigger an attack by giving you insulin and sugar. The sugar is glucose, which reduces potassium level. Or you may be given thyroid hormone.The following signs may be seen during the attack:
 Decreased or no reflexes
 
 Heart arrhythmias
 Low potassium in the bloodstream (potassium levels are normal between attacks)
 Between attacks, the examination is normal. Or, there may be signs of hyperthyroidism. These include an enlarged thyroid changes in the eyes, tremor, or hair and nail changes.The following tests are used to diagnose hyperthyroidism:High thyroid hormone levels (T3 or T4)Low serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levelsThyroid uptake and scanOther test results:Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) during attacksAbnormal electromyogram (EMG) during attacksLow serum potassium during attacks, but normal between attacks A muscle biopsy may sometimes be taken.Treatment

Potassium should also be given during the attack, most often by mouth. If weakness is severe, you may need to get potassium through a vein (IV). Note: You should only get IV if your kidney function is normal and you are monitored in the hospital.Weakness that involves the muscles used for breathing or swallowing is an emergency. People must be taken to a hospital. Serious irregularity of heartbeat also occur during attacks.Your provider may recommend a diet low in carbohydrates and salt to prevent attacks. You may be given beta-blocker medicines to reduce the number and severity of attacks while your hyperthyroidism is brought under control.Acetazolamide is effective at preventing attacks in people with familial periodic paralysis. It is usually not effective for thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.Outlook (Prognosis)

If an attack isn't treated and the breathing muscles are affected, death can occur.Chronic attacks over time can lead to muscle weakness. This weakness can continue even between attacks if the thyrotoxicosis is not treated.TPP responds well to treatment. Treating hyperthyroidism will prevent attacks. It may even reverse muscle weakness.Possible Complications

Untreated TPP can lead to:Difficulty breathing, speaking, or swallowing during attacks (rare)Heart arrhythmias during attacksMuscle weakness that gets worse over timeWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the emergency room if you have periods of muscle weakness. This is especially important if you have a family history of periodic paralysis or thyroid disorders.Emergency symptoms include:
Difficulty breathing, speaking, or swallowing
  Falls due to muscle weakness
  Prevention

Genetic counseling may be advised. Treating the thyroid disorder prevents attacks of weakness.Alternative Names

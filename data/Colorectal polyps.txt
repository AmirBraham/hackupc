 A colorectal polyp is a growth on the lining of the colon or rectum.Causes

Polyps of the colon and rectum are most often benign. This means they are not a cancer. You may have one or many polyps. They become more common with age. There are many types of polyps.Adenomatous polyps are a common type. They are gland-like growths that develop on the mucous membrane that lines the large intestine. They are also called adenomas and are most often one of the following:Tubular polyp, which protrudes out in the lumen (open space) of the colonVillous adenoma, which is sometimes flat and spreading, and is more likely to become a cancer When adenomas become cancerous, they are known as adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that originate in glandular tissue cells. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of colorectal cancer.Other types of polyps are:Hyperplastic polyps, which rarely, if ever, develop into cancerSerrated polyps, which are less common, but may develop into cancer over time Polyps that are 1 centimeter (cm) or larger have a higher cancer risk than polyps smaller than 1 cm. Risk factors include:AgeFamily history of colon cancer or polypsA type of polyp called villous adenoma A small number of people with polyps may also be linked to some inherited disorders, including:Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)Gardner syndrome (a type of FAP)Juvenile polyposis, a disease that causes many benign growths in the intestine, usually before 20 years oldHereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also called Lynch syndrome, a disease that raises the chance of many types of cancer, including in the intestinePeutz-Jeghers syndrome, a disease that causes intestinal polyps, usually in the small intestine and usually benignSymptoms

Polyps usually do not have symptoms. When present, symptoms may include:Blood in the stoolsChange in bowel habitFatigue caused by losing blood over time Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. A large polyp in the rectum may be felt during a rectal exam.Most polyps are found with the following tests:Barium enema (rarely done)ColonoscopySigmoidoscopyStool test for hidden (occult) bloodVirtual colonoscopyStool DNA testFecal immunochemical test (FIT)Treatment

Colorectal polyps should be removed because some can develop into cancer. In most cases, the polyps may be removed during a colonoscopy.For people with adenomatous polyps, new polyps can appear in the future. You should have a repeat colonoscopy, usually 1 to 10 years later, depending on:Your age and general healthNumber of polyps you had Size and type of the polypsFamily history of polyps or cancerIn rare cases, when polyps are very likely to turn into cancer or too large to remove during colonoscopy, the provider will recommend a partial colectomy. This is surgery to remove part of the colon that has the polyps.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outlook is excellent if the polyps are removed. Polyps that are not removed can develop into cancer over time.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have:BloodÂ in a bowel movementChange in bowel habitsPrevention

To reduce your risk of developing polyps:Eat foods low in fat and eat more fruits, vegetables, and fiber.Do not smoke and do not drink alcohol in excess.Maintain a normal body weight.Get regular exercise. Your provider can order a colonoscopy or other screening tests: These tests help prevent colon cancer by finding and removing polyps before they become cancer. This may reduce the chance of developing colon cancer, or at least help catch it in its most treatable stage.All adults should begin one of these tests at age 45.Taking aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, or similar medicines may help reduce the risk for new polyps. Be aware that these medicines can have serious side effects if taken for a long time. Side effects include bleeding in the stomach or colon and heart disease. Talk with your provider before taking these medicines.Alternative Names

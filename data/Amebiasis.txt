 Amebiasis is an infection of the intestines. It is caused by the microscopic parasite Entamoeba histolytica.Causes

E histolytica can live in the large intestine (colon) without causing damage to the intestine. In some cases, it invades the colon wall, causing colitis, acute dysentery, or long-term (chronic) diarrhea. The infection can also spread through the bloodstream to the liver. In rare cases, it can spread to the lungs, brain, or other organs.This condition occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas that have crowded living conditions and poor sanitation. Africa, Mexico, parts of South America, and India have major health problems due to this condition.The parasite may spread:Through food or water contaminated with stoolThrough fertilizer made of human wasteFrom person to person, particularly by contact with the mouth or rectal area of an infected personRisk factors for severe amebiasis include:Alcohol useCancerMalnutritionOlder or younger agePregnancyRecent travel to a tropical regionUse of corticosteroid medicine to suppress the immune systemIn the United States, amebiasis is most common among those who live in institutions or people who have traveled to an area where amebiasis is common.Symptoms

Most people with this infection do not have symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are seen 7 to 28 days after being exposed to the parasite.Mild symptoms may include:Abdominal crampsDiarrhea: passage of 3 to 8 semiformed stools per day, or passage of soft stools with mucus and occasional blood
   FatigueExcessive gasRectal pain while having a bowel movement (tenesmus)Unintentional weight lossSevere symptoms may include:Abdominal tendernessBloody stools, including passage of liquid stools with streaks of blood, passage of 10 to 20 stools per day
   FeverVomitingExams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked about your medical history, especially if you have recently traveled overseas. Examination of the abdomen may show liver enlargement or tenderness in the abdomen (typically in the right upper quadrant).Tests that may be ordered include:Blood test for amebiasisExamination of the inside of the lower large bowel (sigmoidoscopy)Stool testMicroscope examination of stool samples, usually with multiple samples over several daysTreatment

Treatment depends on how severe the infection is. Usually, antibiotics are prescribed.If you are vomiting, you may be given medicines through a vein (intravenously) until you can take them by mouth. Medicines to stop diarrhea are usually not prescribed because they can make the condition worse.After antibiotic treatment, your stool will likely be rechecked to make sure the infection has been cleared.Outlook (Prognosis)

Outcome is usually good with treatment. Usually, the illness lasts about 2 weeks, but it can come back if you do not get treated.Possible Complications

Complications of amebiasis may include:Liver abscess (collection of parasites and pus in the liver)Medicine side effects, including nauseaSpread of the parasite through the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, or other organsWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have diarrhea that does not go away or gets worse.Prevention

When traveling in countries where sanitation is poor, drink purified or boiled water. Do not eat uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit. Wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating.Alternative Names

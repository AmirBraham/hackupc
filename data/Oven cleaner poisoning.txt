Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:Blood and urine testsBreathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was aspirated)Chest x-rayElectrocardiogram (ECG)Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomachFluids through a vein (by IV)Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptomsSurgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowedWashing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several daysOutlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.References

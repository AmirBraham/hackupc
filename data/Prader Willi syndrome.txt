 Prader-Willi syndrome is a disease that is present from birth (congenital). It affects many parts of the body. People with this condition feel hungry all the time and become obese. They also have poor muscle tone, reduced mental ability, and underdeveloped sex organs.Causes

Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a missing gene on chromosome 15. Normally, parents each pass down a copy of this chromosome. The defect can occur in a couple of ways:The father's genes are missing on chromosome 15There are defects or problems with the father's genes on chromosome 15There are two copies of the mother's chromosome 15 and none from the fatherThese genetic changes occur randomly. People who have this syndrome usually do not have a family history of the condition.Symptoms

Signs of Prader-Willi syndrome may be seen at birth.Newborns are often small and floppy with reduced muscle toneMale infants may have undescended testicles Other symptoms may include:Trouble feeding as an infant, with poor weight gainAlmond-shaped eyesDelayed muscle and motor function developmentNarrowed head at the templesRapid weight gainShort statureSlow mental developmentVery small hands and feet in comparison to the child's body Children have an intense craving for food. They will do almost anything to get food, including hoarding. This can result in rapid weight gain and morbid obesity. Morbid obesity may lead to:Type 2 diabetesHigh blood pressureJoint and lung problems Exams and Tests

Genetic testing is available to test children for Prader-Willi syndrome.As the child grows older, lab tests may show signs of morbid obesity, such as:Abnormal glucose toleranceHigh insulin level in the bloodLow oxygen level in the bloodChildren with this syndrome may not respond to luteinizing hormone-releasing factor. This is a sign that their sex organs are not producing hormones. There also may be signs of right-sided heart failure and knee and hip problems.Treatment

Obesity is the greatest threat to health. Limiting calories will control weight gain. It is also important to control a child's environment to prevent access to food. The child's family, neighbors, and school must work together, because the child will try to get food wherever possible. Exercise can help a child with Prader-Willi syndrome gain muscle.Growth hormone is used to treat Prader-Willi syndrome. It can help:Build strength and agilityImprove heightIncrease muscle mass and decrease body fatImprove weight distributionIncrease staminaIncrease bone densityTaking growth hormone therapy may lead to sleep apnea. A child who takes hormone therapy needs to be monitored for sleep apnea.Low levels of sex hormones may be corrected at puberty with hormone replacement.Mental health and behavioral counseling are also important. This can help with common problems such as skin picking and compulsive behaviors. Sometimes, medicine to treat mental health conditions may be needed.Support Groups

The following organizations can provide resources and support:Prader-Willi Syndrome Association -- www.pwsausa.orgFoundation for Prader-Willi Research -- www.fpwr.orgOutlook (Prognosis)

The child will need the right education for their IQ level. The child will also need speech, physical, and occupational therapy as early as possible. Controlling weight will allow for a much more comfortable and healthy life.Possible Complications

Complications of Prader-Willi can include:Type 2 diabetesRight-sided heart failureBone (orthopedic) problems When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if your child has symptoms of this condition. The disorder is frequently suspected at birth.References

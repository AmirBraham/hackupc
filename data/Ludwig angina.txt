 Ludwig angina is an infection of the floor of the mouth under the tongue. It is often due to a bacterial infection of the teeth or jaw.Causes

Ludwig angina is a type of bacterial infection that occurs in the floor of the mouth, under the tongue. It often develops after an infection of the roots of the teeth (such as tooth abscess) or a mouth injury.This condition is uncommon in children.Symptoms

Your tongue may be swollen or pushed up to the top of your mouth.You may need a CT scan.A sample of the fluid from the tissue may be sent to the lab to test for bacteria.Treatment

If the swelling blocks the airway, you need to get emergency medical help right away. A breathing tube may needed to be placed through your mouth or nose and into the lungs to restore breathing. You may need to have surgery called a tracheostomy that creates an opening through the neck into the windpipe.Antibiotics are given to fight the infection. They are most often given through a vein until symptoms go away. Antibiotics taken by mouth may be continued until tests show that the bacteria have gone away.Dental treatment may be needed for tooth infections that cause Ludwig angina.Surgery may be needed to drain fluids that are causing the swelling.Outlook (Prognosis)

 Tongue problems include pain, swelling, or a change in how the tongue looks or functions.Considerations

The tongue is mainly made up of muscles. It is covered with a mucous membrane. Small bumps (papillae) cover the surface of back part of the tongue.Between the papillae are the taste buds, which allow you to taste.The tongue moves food to help you chew and swallow.The tongue also helps you form words. There are many different reasons for changes in the tongue's function and appearance.PROBLEMS MOVING THE TONGUETongue movement problems are most often caused by nerve damage. Rarely, problems moving the tongue may also be caused by a disorder where the band of tissue that attaches the tongue to the floor of the mouth is too short. This is called ankyloglossia.Tongue movement problems may lead to:Breastfeeding problems in newbornsDifficulty moving food during chewing and swallowingSpeech problems TASTE PROBLEMSTaste problems can be caused by:Damage to the taste budsNerve problemsSide effects of some medicinesAn infection, or other condition The tongue normally senses sweet, salty, sour, and bitter tastes.

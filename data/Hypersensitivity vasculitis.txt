 Hypersensitivity vasculitis is an extreme reaction to a drug, infection, or foreign substance. It leads to inflammation and damage to blood vessels, mainly in the skin. The term is not used much currently because more specific names are considered more precise.Causes

Hypersensitivity vasculitis, or cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, is caused by:An allergic reaction to a drug or other foreign substanceA reaction to an infectionIt usually affects people older than age 16.Often, the cause of the problem cannot be found even with a careful study of the person's medical history.Hypersensitivity vasculitis may look like systemic, necrotizing vasculitis, which can affect blood vessels throughout the body and not just in the skin. In children, it can look like Henoch-Schonlein purpura.Symptoms

Symptoms may include:New rash with tender, purple or brownish-red spots over large areasSkin sores mostly located on the legs, buttocks, or trunkBlisters on the skinHives (urticaria), may last longer than 24 hoursOpen sores with dead tissue (necrotic ulcers)Exams and Tests

The health care provider will base the diagnosis on symptoms. The provider will review any medicines or drugs you have taken and recent infections. You will be asked about cough, fever, or chest pain.A complete physical exam will be done.Blood and urine tests may be done to look for systemic disorders such systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, or hepatitis C. The blood tests may include:Complete blood count with differentialC-reactive proteinErythrocyte sedimentation rateChemistry panel with liver enzymes and creatinineAntinuclear antibody (ANA)Rheumatoid factorAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)Complement levelsCryoglobulinsHepatitis B and C testsHIV testUrinalysisSkin biopsy shows inflammation of the small blood vessels.Treatment

The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation.Your provider may prescribe aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or corticosteroids to reduce inflammation of the blood vessels. (Do not give aspirin to children except as advised by your provider).Your provider will tell you to stop taking medicines that could be causing this condition.Outlook (Prognosis)

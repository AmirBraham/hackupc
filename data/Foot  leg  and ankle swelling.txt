 Painless swelling of the feet and ankles is a common problem, especially among older people.Abnormal buildup of fluid in the ankles, feet, and legs can cause swelling. This fluid buildup and swelling is called edema.Considerations

Painless swelling may affect both legs and may include the calves or even the thighs. The effect of gravity makes the swelling most noticeable in the lower part of your body.Causes

Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:Is overweightHas a blood clot in the legIs olderHas a leg infectionHas veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart (called venous insufficiency, most often due to varicose veins)Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and significant swelling. Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body, and it collects in the legs.Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclicsBlood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockersHormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosteroneSteroids Home Care

Some tips that may help reduce swelling:Put your legs on pillows to raise them above your heart while lying down.Exercise your legs. This helps pump fluid from your legs back to your heart.Follow a low-salt diet, which may reduce fluid buildup and swelling.Wear support stockings (sold at most drugstores and medical supply stores).When traveling, take breaks often to stand up and move around.Avoid wearing tight clothing or garters around your thighs.Lose weight if you need to.Never stop taking any medicines you think may be causing swelling without first talking to your health care provider.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Vertigo is a sensation of motion or spinning that is often described as dizziness.Vertigo is not the same as being lightheaded. People with vertigo feel as though they are actually spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around them.Causes

There are two types of vertigo, peripheral and central vertigo.Peripheral vertigo is due to a problem in the part of the inner ear that controls balance. These areas are called the vestibular labyrinth, or semicircular canals. The problem may also involve the vestibular nerve. This is the nerve between the inner ear and the brain stem.Peripheral vertigo may be caused by:Benign positional vertigo (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, also known as BPPV)Certain medicines, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, cisplatin, diuretics, or salicylates, which are toxic to the inner ear structuresInjury (such as head injury)Inflammation of the vestibular nerve (neuronitis)
   Irritation and swelling of the inner ear (labyrinthitis)Meniere diseasePressure on the vestibular nerve, usually from a noncancerous tumor such as a meningioma or schwannomaCentral vertigo is due to a problem in the brain, usually in the brain stem or the back part of the brain (cerebellum).Central vertigo may be caused by:Blood vessel diseaseCertain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, aspirin, and alcoholMultiple sclerosisSeizures (rarely)StrokeTumors (cancerous or noncancerous)Vestibular migraine, a type of migraine headacheSymptoms

The main symptom is a sensation that you or the room is moving or spinning. The spinning sensation may cause nausea and vomiting.Depending on the cause, other symptoms can include:Problem focusing the eyesDizzinessHearing loss in one or both earsLoss of balance (may cause falls)Ringing in the ears Nausea and vomiting, leading to loss of body fluidsIf you have vertigo due to problems in the brain (central vertigo), you may have other symptoms, including:Difficulty swallowingDouble visionEye movement problemsFacial paralysisSlurred speechWeakness of the limbs Exams and Tests

Examination by the health care provider may show:Problems walking due to loss of balanceEye movement problems or involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)Hearing lossLack of coordination and balanceWeakness Tests that may be done include:Blood testsBrainstem auditory evoked potential studiesCaloric stimulationElectroencephalogram (EEG)ElectronystagmographyHead CTLumbar punctureMRI scan of head and MRA scan of blood vessels of the brainWalking (gait) testingThe provider may perform certain head movements on you, such as the head-thrust test. These tests help tell the difference between central and peripheral vertigo.Treatment

The cause of any brain disorder causing vertigo should be identified and treated when possible.To help resolve symptoms of benign positional vertigo, the provider may perform the Epley maneuver on you. This involves placing your head in different positions to help reset the balance organ.You may be prescribed medicines to treat symptoms of peripheral vertigo, such as nausea and vomiting.Physical therapy may help improve balance problems. You'll be taught exercises to restore your sense of balance. Exercises can also strengthen your muscles to help prevent falls.To prevent worsening of symptoms during an episode of vertigo, try the following:Keep still. Sit or lie down when symptoms occur.Gradually resume activity.Avoid sudden position changes.Do not try to read when symptoms occur.Avoid bright lights.You may need help walking when symptoms occur. Avoid hazardous activities such as driving, operating heavy machinery, and climbing until 1 week after symptoms have disappeared.Other treatment depends on the cause of the vertigo. Surgery, including microvascular decompression, may be suggested in some cases.Possible Complications

Vertigo can interfere with driving, work, and lifestyle. It can also cause falls, which can lead to many injuries, including hip fractures.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider for an appointment if you have vertigo that does not go away or interferes with your daily activities. If you have never had vertigo or if you have vertigo with other symptoms (such as double vision, slurred speech, or loss of coordination), call 911 or the local emergency number.Alternative Names

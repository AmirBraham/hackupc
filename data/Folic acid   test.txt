This test is done to check for folic acid deficiency.Folic acid helps form red blood cells and produce DNA that stores genetic codes. Taking the right amount of folic acid before and during pregnancy helps prevent neural tube defects, such as spina bifida.Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should take at least 600 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. It may be provided by prenatal vitamins and certain foods, such as enriched bread, flour, and cereal. Some women may need to take more if they have a history of neural tube defects in earlier pregnancies. Ask your provider how much you need.Normal Results

The normal range is 2.7 to 17.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or 6.12 to 38.52 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L).Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.What Abnormal Results Mean

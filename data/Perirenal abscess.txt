 Perirenal abscess is a pocket of pus around one or both kidneys. It is caused by an infection.Causes

Most perirenal abscesses are caused by a urinary tract infection that starts in the bladder. It then spreads to the kidney, and to the area around the kidney. Surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system or a bloodstream infection can also lead to a perirenal abscess.The biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is kidney stones, by blockage of urine flow. This provides a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics cannot kill the bacteria there.Stones are found in 20% to 60% of people with perirenal abscess. Other risk factors for perirenal abscess include:DiabetesHaving an abnormal urinary tractTrauma to the kidneyIV (intravenous) drug use Symptoms

Symptoms of perirenal abscess include:ChillsFeverPain in the flank (side of the abdomen) or abdomen, which may extend to the groin or down the legSweating Exams and Tests

To treat perirenal abscess, the pus can be drained through a catheter that is placed through the skin or with surgery. Antibiotics should also be given, at first through a vein (IV), then can switch to pills when the infection starts improving.Outlook (Prognosis)

In general, quick diagnosis and treatment of a perirenal abscess should lead to a good outcome. Kidney stones must be treated to avoid further infections.In rare cases, the infection can spread beyond the kidney area and into the bloodstream. This can be deadly.Possible Complications

If you have kidney stones, the infection may not go away.You may need to have the infection surgically removed.You may have to have the kidney removed if infection cannot be cleared or is recurrent. This is rare.When to Contact a Medical Professional

 Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. It is needed for normal growth and development.Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. Although the body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins, they have to be taken regularly to prevent a shortage in the body.Function

Vitamin C is needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body. It is used to:Form an important protein called collagen, used to make skin, tendons, ligaments, and blood vesselsHeal wounds and form scar tissueRepair and maintain cartilage, bones, and teethAid in the absorption of iron Vitamin C is one of many antioxidants. Antioxidants are nutrients that block some of the damage caused by free radicals.Free radicals are made when your body breaks down food or when you are exposed to tobacco smoke or radiation.The buildup of free radicals over time is largely responsible for the aging process.Free radicals may play a role in cancer, heart disease, and conditions like arthritis. The body is not able to make vitamin C on its own. It does not store vitamin C. It is therefore important to include plenty of vitamin C-containing foods in your daily diet.For many years, vitamin C has been a popular household remedy for the common cold.Research shows that for most people, vitamin C supplements or vitamin C-rich foods do not reduce the risk of getting the common cold.However, people who take vitamin C supplements regularly might have slightly shorter colds or somewhat milder symptoms.Taking a vitamin C supplement after a cold starts does not appear to be helpful.Food Sources

All fruits and vegetables contain some amount of vitamin C.Fruits with the highest content of vitamin C include:CantaloupeCitrus fruits and juices, such as orange and grapefruitKiwi fruitMangoPapayaPineappleStrawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and cranberriesWatermelon Vegetables with the highest sources of vitamin C include:Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflowerGreen and red peppersSpinach, cabbage, turnip greens, and other leafy greensSweet and white potatoesTomatoes and tomato juiceWinter squash Some cereals and other foods and beverages are fortified with vitamin C. Fortified means a vitamin or mineral has been added to the food. Check the product labels to see how much vitamin C is in the product.The best food sources of vitamin C are uncooked or raw fruits and vegetables. Cooking vitamin C-rich foods or storing them for a long period of time can reduce the vitamin C content. Microwaving and steaming vitamin C-rich foods may reduce cooking losses. Exposure to light can also reduce vitamin C content. Choose orange juice that is sold in a carton instead of a clear bottle. Side Effects

Serious side effects from too much vitamin C are very rare, because the body cannot store the vitamin. However, amounts greater than 2,000 mg/day are not recommended. Doses this high can lead to stomach upset and diarrhea, and rarely, kidney stones. Large doses of vitamin C supplementation are not recommended during pregnancy. They can lead to shortage of vitamin C in the baby after delivery. Too little vitamin C can lead to signs and symptoms of deficiency, including:AnemiaBleeding gumsDecreased ability to fight infectionDecreased wound-healing rateDry and splitting hairEasy bruisingGingivitis (inflammation of the gums)NosebleedsPossible weight gain because of slowed metabolismRough, dry, scaly skinSwollen and painful jointsWeakened tooth enamel A severe form of vitamin C deficiency is known as scurvy. This mainly affects older, malnourished adults.Recommendations

Recommendations for vitamin C, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.Adequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.Dietary reference intakes for vitamin C:Infants (AI)0 to 6 months: 40 milligrams/day (mg/day)7 to 12 months: 50 mg/day Children (RDA)1 to 3 years: 15 mg/day4 to 8 years: 25 mg/day9 to 13 years: 45 mg/day AdolescentsGirls 14 to 18 years: 65 mg/dayPregnant teens: 80 mg/dayBreastfeeding teens: 115 mg/dayBoys 14 to 18 years: 75 mg/day AdultsMen age 19 and older: 90 mg/dayWomen age 19 year and older: 75 mg/dayPregnant women: 85 mg/dayBreastfeeding women: 120 mg/day The best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins, including vitamin C, is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods.Smokers or those who are around secondhand smoke at any age should increase their daily amount of vitamin C by an additional 35 mg per day.Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and those who smoke need higher amounts of vitamin C. Ask your health care provider what amount is best for you.Alternative Names

 Coughing up blood is the spitting up of blood or bloody mucus from the lungs and throat (respiratory tract).Hemoptysis is the medical term for coughing up blood from the respiratory tract.Considerations

Coughing up blood is not the same as bleeding from the mouth, throat, or gastrointestinal tract.Blood that comes up with a cough often looks bubbly because it is mixed with air and mucus. It is most often bright red, although it may be rust-colored. Sometimes the mucus contains only streaks of blood.The outlook depends on what is causing the problem. Most people do well with treatment to treat the symptoms and the underlying disease. People with severe hemoptysis may die.Causes

A number of conditions, diseases, and medical tests may make you cough up blood. These include:
  Blood clot in the lung
  
  Breathing food or other material into the lungs (pulmonary aspiration)
  Bronchoscopy with biopsy
  BronchiectasisBronchitisLung cancerCystic fibrosisInflammation of the blood vessels in the lung (vasculitis)Injury to the arteries of the lungsIrritation of the throat from violent coughing (small amounts of blood)Pneumonia or other lung infectionsPulmonary edemaSystemic lupus erythematosusTuberculosisVery thin blood (from blood thinning medicines, most often at higher than recommended levels)Home Care

Medicines that stop coughing (cough suppressants) may help if the problem comes from heavy coughing. These medicines may lead to airway blockages, so check with your health care provider before using them.Keep track of how long you cough up blood, and how much blood is mixed with the mucus. Call your provider any time you cough up blood, even if you do not have any other symptoms.When to Contact a Medical Professional

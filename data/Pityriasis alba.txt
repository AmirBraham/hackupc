 Pityriasis alba is a common skin disorder that causes patches of light-colored (hypopigmented) areas.Causes

The cause is unknown but may be linked to atopic dermatitis (eczema). The disorder is most common in children and teens. It is more noticeable in children with dark skin.Symptoms

The problem areas on the skin (lesions) often start as slightly red and scaly patches that are round or oval. They usually appear on the face, upper arms, neck, and upper middle of the body. After these lesions go away, the patches turn light-colored (hypopigmented).The patches do not tan easily. Because of this, they may get red quickly in the sun. As the skin surrounding the patches darkens normally, the patches may become more visible.Exams and Tests

Your health care provider can usually diagnose the condition by looking at the skin. Tests, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH), may be done to check for other skin problems. In very rare cases, a skin biopsy is done.Treatment

Your provider may recommend the following treatments:MoisturizerMild steroid creamsMedicine, called immunomodulators, applied to the skin to reduce inflammationTreatment with ultraviolet light to control the inflammationMedicines by mouth or shots to control the dermatitis, if severeLaser treatmentOutlook (Prognosis)

Pityriasis alba usually goes away on its own with patches returning to normal pigment over many months.Possible Complications

Patches may get sunburned when exposed to sunlight. Applying sunscreen and using other sun protection can help prevent sunburn.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if your child has patches of hypopigmented skin.References

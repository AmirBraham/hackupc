 Most of the time, your urine is sterile. This means there are no bacteria growing. On the other hand, if you have symptoms of a bladder or kidney infection, bacteria will often be present and growing in your urine.Sometimes, your health care provider may check your urine for bacteria, even when you do not have any symptoms. If enough bacteria are found in your urine, you have asymptomatic bacteriuria.Causes

Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in a small number of healthy people. It affects women more often than men. The reasons for the lack of symptoms are not well understood.You are more likely to have this problem if you:Have a urinary catheter in placeAre femaleAre pregnantAre sexually active (in females)Have long-term diabetes and are femaleAre an older adultHave recently had a surgical procedure in your urinary tractSymptoms

There are no symptoms of this problem.If you have these symptoms, you may have a urinary tract infection, but you do not have asymptomatic bacteriuria.Burning during urinationIncreased urgency to urinateIncreased frequency of urinationExams and Tests

To diagnose asymptomatic bacteriuria, a urine sample must be sent for a urine culture. Most people with no urinary tract symptoms do not need this test.You may need a urine culture done as a screening test, even without symptoms, if:You are pregnantYou have a surgery or procedure planned that involves the bladder, prostate, or other parts of the urinary tractTo make the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the culture must show a large growth of bacteria.In men, only one culture needs to show growth of bacteriaIn women, two different cultures must show growth of bacteriaTreatment

Most people who have bacteria growing in their urine, but no symptoms, do not need treatment. This is because the bacteria are not causing any harm. In fact, treating most people with this problem may make it harder to treat infections in the future.However, for some people getting a urinary tract infection is more likely or may cause more severe problems. As a result, treatment with antibiotics may be needed if:You are pregnant.You recently had a kidney transplant.You are scheduled for surgery involving the prostate gland or the bladder.You have kidney stones that have caused an infection.Your young child has reflux (backward movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys).Without symptoms being present, even people who are older adults, have diabetes, or have a catheter in place do not need treatment.Possible Complications

If it is not treated, you may have a kidney infection if you are at high risk.When to Contact a Medical Professional

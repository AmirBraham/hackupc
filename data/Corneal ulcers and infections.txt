 The cornea is the clear tissue at the front of the eye. A corneal ulcer is an open sore in the outer layer of the cornea. It is often caused by infection. At first, a corneal ulcer may seem like conjunctivitis, or pink eye.Causes

Corneal ulcers are most commonly caused by an infection with bacteria, viruses, fungi, or a parasite.Acanthamoeba keratitis occurs in contact lens users. It is more likely to happen in people who make their own homemade cleaning solutions.Fungal keratitis can occur after a corneal injury involving plant material. It may also occur in people with a suppressed immune system.Herpes simplex keratitis is a serious viral infection. It may cause repeated attacks that are triggered by stress, exposure to sunlight, or any condition that lowers the immune response. Corneal ulcers or infections may also be caused by:Eyelids that do not close all the way, such as with Bell palsyForeign bodies in the eyeScratches (abrasions) on the eye surfaceSeverely dry eyesSevere allergic eye diseaseVarious inflammatory disorders Wearing contact lenses, especially soft contacts that are left in overnight, may cause a corneal ulcer.Watch this video about:Corneal injurySymptoms

Your health care provider may do the following tests:Exam of scrapings from the ulcerFluorescein stain of the corneaKeratometry (measuring the curve of the cornea)Pupillary reflex responseRefraction testSlit-lamp examinationTests for dry eyeVisual acuityBlood tests to check for inflammatory disorders may also be needed.Using newer information systems to evaluate photos of corneal ulcers may allow earlier diagnosis and treatment.Treatment

Treatment for corneal ulcers and infections depends on the cause. Treatment should be started as soon as possible to prevent scarring of the cornea.If the exact cause is not known, you may be given antibiotic drops that work against many kinds of bacteria.Once the exact cause is known, you may be given drops that treat bacteria, herpes, other viruses, or a fungus.

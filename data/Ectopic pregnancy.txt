 An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb (uterus).Causes

In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include:Birth defect in the fallopian tubesScarring after a ruptured appendixEndometriosisHaving had an ectopic pregnancy in the pastScarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs The following also increase risk for an ectopic pregnancy:Age over 35Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD)Having your tubes tiedHaving had surgery to untie tubes to become pregnantHaving had many sexual partnersSexually transmitted infections (STI)Some infertility treatments Sometimes, the cause is not known. Hormones may play a role.The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. In rare cases, this can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix. An ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control.Symptoms

Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy may include:Abnormal vaginal bleedingMild cramping on one side of the pelvisNo periodsPain in the lower belly or pelvic area If the area around the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include:Fainting or feeling faintIntense pressure in the rectumLow blood pressurePain in the shoulder areaSevere, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen Exams and Tests

The health care provider will do a pelvic exam. The exam may show tenderness in the pelvic area.A pregnancy test and vaginal ultrasound will be done. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone that is produced during pregnancy. Checking the blood level of this hormone can detect pregnancy.When hCG levels are above a certain value, a pregnancy sac in the uterus should be seen with ultrasound. If the sac is not seen, this may indicate that an ectopic pregnancy is present.You may need more than one exam, ultrasound, and blood test. Your provider will instruct you about signs to watch for until your next visit.Treatment

Ectopic pregnancy may be life threatening. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth (term).Â  Effective treatment requires either medical treatment to end the pregnancy or surgical removal of the pregnancy.If the ectopic pregnancy has not ruptured, treatment may include:SurgeryMedicine that ends the pregnancy, along with close monitoring by your doctorYou will need emergency medical help if the area of the ectopic pregnancy breaks open (ruptures). Rupture can lead to bleeding and shock. Treatment for shock may include:Blood transfusionFluids given through a veinKeeping warmOxygenRaising the legs If there is a rupture, surgery is done to stop blood loss and remove the pregnancy. In some cases, the doctor may have to remove the fallopian tube.Outlook (Prognosis)

If diagnosed early, treatment is very effective. It's important to seek early care whenever you believe you may be pregnant so your provider may determine the location of the pregnancy.One out of three women who have had one ectopic pregnancy can have a baby in the future. Another ectopic pregnancy is more likely to occur. Some women do not become pregnant again.The likelihood of a successful pregnancy after an ectopic pregnancy depends on:The woman's ageWhether she has already had childrenWhy the first ectopic pregnancy occurred The health of her fallopian tubesWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have: Abnormal vaginal bleedingLower abdominal or pelvic pain orSuspect you might be pregnantPrevention

Most forms of ectopic pregnancy that occur outside the fallopian tubes are probably not preventable. You may be able to reduce your risk by avoiding conditions that may scar the fallopian tubes. These steps include: Practicing safer sex by taking steps before and during sex, which can prevent you from getting an infectionGetting early diagnosis and treatment of all STIsStopping smoking Alternative Names

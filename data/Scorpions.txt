Scorpion venom contains many toxins as well as the chemical histamine.Where Found

This venom is found in scorpions and related species. More than 40 species of scorpions are found in the United States.The class of animals to which scorpions belong contains the largest number of venomous species known.Scorpion stings kill more people around the world than any other animal, except snakes (from snake bites). However, most varieties of North American scorpions are NOT venomous. The venomous ones in the United States live mainly in the southwestern deserts. Symptoms

In mild cases, the only symptom may be a mild tingling or burning at the site of the sting.In severe cases, symptoms in different parts of the body may include:EYES AND EARSDouble vision LUNGSDifficulty breathingNo breathingRapid breathing NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROATDroolingItching of the nose and throatSpasm of the larynx (voice box)Tongue that feels thick HEART AND BLOODIncreased or decreased heart rateIrregular heartbeatKIDNEYS AND BLADDERInability to hold in urineDecreased urine outputMUSCLES AND JOINTSMuscle spasmsNERVOUS SYSTEMAnxietyConvulsions (seizures)ParalysisRandom movements of the head, eye, or neckRestlessnessStiffness SKINHeightened sensitivity to touch in the area of the stingSweating

Most stings from North American scorpions do not need treatment. Children 6 years and younger are more likely to have harmful effects from venomous types of scorpions.Clean the area thoroughly with soap and water.Place ice (wrapped in a clean cloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has problems with blood circulation, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading.Loosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.Give the person diphenhydramine (Benadryl and other brands) by mouth if they can swallow. This antihistamine drug may be used alone for mild symptoms.Before Calling Emergency

Take the insect with you to the hospital, if possible. Make sure it is in a tightly closed container.The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The wound and symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:Blood and urine testsBreathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine (ventilator)Chest x-rayECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)Fluids through a vein (by IV)Medicine to reverse the effect of the venomMedicine to treat symptoms Outlook (Prognosis)

Death from scorpion stings rarely occurs in people older than 6 years. If symptoms rapidly become worse within the first 2 to 4 hours after the sting, a poor outcome is more likely. Symptoms may last several days or longer. Some deaths have occurred as late as weeks after the sting if complications develop.Scorpions are nocturnal predatory animals that usually spend the day under rocks, logs, or floors and in crevices. DO NOT put your hands or feet in these hiding places.References

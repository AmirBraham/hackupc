 McCune-Albright syndrome is a genetic disease that affects the bones, hormones, and color (pigmentation) of the skin.Causes

McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by mutations in the GNAS gene. A small number, but not all, of the person's cells contain this faulty gene (mosaicism).This disease is not inherited. Symptoms

The main symptom of McCune-Albright syndrome is early puberty in girls. Menstrual periods may begin in early childhood, long before the breasts or pubic hair develop (which normally occur first). The average age that symptoms appear is 3 years old. However, puberty and menstrual bleeding have occurred as early as 4 to 6 months in girls.Early sexual development may also occur in boys, but not as often as in girls.Other symptoms include:Bone fracturesDeformities of the bones in the faceGigantismIrregular, large patchy café au lait spotsExams and Tests

A physical examination may show signs of:Abnormal bone growth in the skullAbnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)AcromegalyGigantismLarge cafe-au-lait spots on the skinLiver disease, jaundice, fatty liverScar-like tissue in the bone (fibrous dysplasia) Tests may show:Adrenal abnormalitiesHigh level of parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism)High level of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) Adrenal hormone abnormalitiesLow level of phosphorous in the blood (hypophosphatemia)Ovarian cystsPituitary or thyroid tumorsAbnormal blood prolactin levelAbnormal growth hormone level Other tests that may be done include:MRI of the headX-rays of the bones Genetic testing may be done to confirm the diagnosis.Treatment

There is no specific treatment for McCune-Albright syndrome. Drugs that block estrogen production, such as testolactone, have been tried with some success.Adrenal abnormalities (such as Cushing syndrome) may be treated with surgery to remove the adrenal glands. Gigantism and pituitary adenoma will need to be treated with medicines that block hormone production, or with surgery.Bone abnormalities (fibrous dysplasia) are sometimes removed with surgery.Limit the number of x-rays taken of affected areas of the body.Outlook (Prognosis)

Lifespan is relatively normal.Possible Complications

Complications may include:BlindnessCosmetic problems from bone abnormalitiesDeafnessOsteitis fibrosa cysticaPremature pubertyRepeated broken bonesTumors of the bone (rare)When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if your child starts puberty early, or has other symptoms of McCune-Albright syndrome. Genetic counseling, and possibly genetic testing, may be suggested if the disease is detected.Alternative Names

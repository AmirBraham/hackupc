 Shoulder pain is any pain in or around the shoulder joint.Considerations

The shoulder is the most movable joint in the human body. A group of four muscles and their tendons, called the rotator cuff, give the shoulder its wide range of motion.Swelling, damage, or bone changes around the rotator cuff can cause shoulder pain. You may have pain when lifting the arm above your head or moving it forward or behind your back.Causes

The most common cause of shoulder pain occurs when rotator cuff tendons become trapped under the bony area in the shoulder. The tendons become inflamed or damaged. This condition is called rotator cuff tendinitis or bursitis.Shoulder pain may also be caused by:Arthritis in the shoulder jointBone spurs in the shoulder areaBursitis, which is inflammation of a fluid-filled sac (bursa) that normally protects the joint and helps it move smoothlyBroken shoulder boneDislocation of the shoulderShoulder separationFrozen shoulder, which occurs when the muscles, tendons, and ligaments inside the shoulder become stiff, making movement difficult and painfulOveruse or injury of nearby tendons, such as the bicep muscles of the armsNerve injury that leads to abnormal shoulder movementTears of the rotator cuff tendons Poor shoulder posture and mechanicsSometimes, shoulder pain may be due to a problem in another area of the body, such as the neck or lungs. This is called referred pain. There is usually pain at rest and no worsening of pain when moving the shoulder.Home Care

Here are some tips for helping shoulder pain get better:Put ice on the shoulder area for 15 minutes, then leave it off for 15 minutes. Do this 3 to 4 times a day for 2 to 3 days. Wrap the ice in cloth. Do not put ice directly on the skin because this can result in frostbite.Rest your shoulder for the next few days.Slowly return to your regular activities. A physical therapist can help you do this safely.Taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) may help reduce inflammation and pain. Rotator cuff problems can be treated at home also.If you have had shoulder pain before, use ice and ibuprofen after exercising.Learn exercises to stretch and strengthen your rotator cuff tendons and shoulder muscles. A health care provider or physical therapist can recommend such exercises.If you are recovering from tendinitis, continue to do range-of-motion exercises to avoid frozen shoulder.Practice good posture to keep your shoulder muscles and tendons in their right positions.

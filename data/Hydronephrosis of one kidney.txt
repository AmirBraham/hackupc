 Hydronephrosis is swelling of one kidney due to a backup of urine. This problem may occur in one kidney.Causes

Hydronephrosis (kidney swelling) occurs as the result of a disease. It is not a disease itself. Conditions that may lead to hydronephrosis include:Blockage of a ureter due to scarring caused by prior infections, surgeries, or radiation treatmentsBlockage from an enlarged uterus during pregnancyBirth defects of the urinary systemBack flow of urine from bladder to kidney, called vesicoureteral reflux (may occur as a birth defect or due to an enlarged prostate or narrowing of the urethra)Kidney stonesCancers or tumors that occur in the ureter, bladder, pelvis or abdomen Problems with the nerves that supply the bladderThe blockage and swelling of the kidney may occur suddenly or may develop slowly.Symptoms

Common symptoms include:Flank painAbdominal mass, especially in childrenNausea and vomitingUrinary tract infection (UTI)FeverPainful urination (dysuria)Increased urinary frequencyIncreased urinary urgency In some cases, there may be no symptoms.Exams and Tests

The condition is found on an imaging test such as:MRI of the abdomenCT scan of the kidneys or abdomenIntravenous pyelogram (IVP)Kidney scanUltrasound of the kidneys or abdomen Treatment

Treatment depends on the cause of the kidney swelling. Treatment may include:Placing a stent (tube) through the bladder and ureter to allow urine to flow from the kidney into the bladder Placing a tube into the kidney through the skin to allow the blocked urine to drain out of the body into a drainage bagAntibiotics for infectionsSurgery to correct the blockage or refluxRemoval of any stone that is causing blockage People who have only one kidney, who have immune system disorders such as diabetes or HIV, or who have had a transplant will need treatment right away.People who have long-term hydronephrosis may need antibiotics to reduce the risk of UTI.Outlook (Prognosis)

Loss of kidney function, UTI, and pain may occur if the condition is left untreated.Possible Complications

If hydronephrosis is not treated, the affected kidney may be permanently damaged. Kidney failure is rare if the other kidney is working normally. However, kidney failure will occur if there is only one functioning kidney. UTI and pain may also occur.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your health care provider if you have ongoing or severe flank pain, or fever, or if you think you may have hydronephrosis.Prevention

Prevention of the disorders that cause this condition will prevent it from occurring. Alternative Names

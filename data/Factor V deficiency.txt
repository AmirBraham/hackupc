 Factor V deficiency is a bleeding disorder that is passed down through families. It affects the ability of the blood to clot.Causes

Blood clotting is a complex process involving as many as 20 different proteins in blood plasma. These proteins are called blood coagulation factors. Factor V deficiency is caused by a lack of factor V. When certain blood clotting factors are low or missing, your blood does not clot properly. Factor V deficiency is rare. It may be caused by: A defective factor V gene passed down through families (inherited)An antibody that interferes with normal factor V function You can develop an antibody that interferes with factor V:After giving birthAfter being treated with a certain type of fibrin glueAfter surgeryWith autoimmune diseases and certain cancers Sometimes the cause is unknown.The disease is similar to hemophilia, except bleeding into joints is less common. In the inherited form of factor V deficiency, a family history of a bleeding disorder is a risk factor.Symptoms

Excessive bleeding with menstrual periods and after childbirth often occurs. Other symptoms can include:
Bleeding into the skinBleeding of the gumsExcessive bruisingNosebleedsProlonged or excessive loss of blood with surgery or traumaUmbilical stump bleeding Exams and Tests

Tests to detect factor V deficiency include:Factor V assayBlood clotting tests, including partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin timeBleeding timeTreatment

You will be given fresh blood plasma or fresh frozen plasma infusions during a bleeding episode or after surgery. These treatments will correct the deficiency temporarily.Outlook (Prognosis)

The outlook is good with diagnosis and proper treatment.Possible Complications

Severe bleeding (hemorrhage) could occur.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have an unexplained or prolonged loss of blood.Alternative Names

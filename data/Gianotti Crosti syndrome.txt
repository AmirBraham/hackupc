 Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a childhood skin condition that may be accompanied by mild symptoms of fever and malaise. It may also be associated with hepatitis B and other viral infections.Causes

Health care providers don't know the exact cause of this disorder. They do know that it is linked with other infections.In Italian children, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is seen frequently with hepatitis BÂ infection. But this link is rarely seen in the United States. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, mononucleosis) is the virus most often associated with acrodermatitis.Other associated viruses include:CytomegalovirusCoxsackie virusesParainfluenza virusRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)Some types of live virus vaccines Symptoms

Skin symptoms may include any of the following:Rash or patch on the skin, usually on the arms and legsBrownish-red or copper-colored patch that is firm and flat on topString of bumps may appear in a lineGenerally not itchyRash looks the same on both sides of the bodyRash may appear on the palms and soles, but not on the back, chest, or belly area (this is one of the ways it is identified, by the absence of the rash on the trunk of the body) Other symptoms that may appear include:Swollen abdomenSwollen lymph nodesTender lymph nodes Exams and Tests

Your provider can diagnose this condition by looking at your skin and rash. Your liver, spleen, and lymph nodes may be swollen.The following tests may be done to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other conditions:Bilirubin levelHepatitis virus serology or hepatitis B surface antigenLiver enzymes (liver function tests)Screening for EBV antibodiesSkin biopsyTreatment

The disorder itself is not treated. Infections linked with this condition, such as hepatitis B and Epstein-Barr, are treated. Cortisone creams and oral antihistamines may help with itching and irritation.Outlook (Prognosis)

The rash usually disappears on its own in about 3 to 8 weeks without treatment or complication. Associated conditions must be watched carefully.Possible Complications

Complications occur as a result of associated conditions, rather than as a result of the rash.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your provider if your child has signs of this condition.Alternative Names

 Peritonitis is an inflammation (irritation) of the peritoneum. This is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs.Causes

Peritonitis is caused by a collection of blood, body fluids, or pus in the belly (abdomen).One type is called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SPP). It occurs in people with ascites. Ascites is the buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and the organs. This problem is found in people with long-term liver damage, certain cancers, and heart failure.Peritonitis may be a result of other problems. This is known as secondary peritonitis. Problems that may lead to this type of peritonitis include:Trauma or wounds to the bellyRuptured appendixRuptured diverticulaInfection after any surgery in the belly Symptoms

The belly is very painful or tender. The pain may become worse when the belly is touched or when you move.Your belly may look or feel bloated. This is called abdominal distention.Other symptoms may include:Fever and chillsPassing little or no stools or gasExcessive fatiguePassing less urineNausea and vomitingRacing heartbeatShortness of breath Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. The abdomen is usually tender. It may feel firm or "board-like." People with peritonitis usually curl up or refuse to let anyone touch the area.Blood tests, x-rays, and CT scans may be done. If there is a lot of fluid in the belly area, the provider may use a needle to remove some and send it for testing.Treatment

The cause must be identified and treated right away. Treatment typically involves surgery, antibiotics, or both.Possible Complications

Peritonitis can be life threatening and may cause complications. These depend on the type of peritonitis.When to Contact a Medical Professional

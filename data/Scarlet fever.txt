 Scarlet fever is caused by an infection with bacteria called group A streptococcus. This is the same bacteria that cause strep throat.Causes

Scarlet fever used to be a severe childhood disease. The group A strep bacteria produce a toxin that causes a distinctive red rash, which led to the name.The main risk factor for getting scarlet fever is infection with the bacteria that cause strep throat. An outbreak of strep throat or scarlet fever in the community, neighborhood, or school may increase the risk of infection.Symptoms

The time between infection and symptoms is short, most often 1 to 2 days. The illness will likely begin with a fever and sore throat.The rash first appears on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body. People say it feels like sandpaper. The texture of the rash is more important than the appearance to confirm the diagnosis. The rash can last for more than a week. As the rash fades, the skin around the fingertips, toes, and groin area may peel.Other symptoms include:Abdominal painBright red color in the creases of the underarm and groinChillsFeverGeneral discomfort (malaise)HeadacheMuscle achesSore throatSwollen, red tongue (strawberry tongue)Vomiting Exams and Tests

Your health care provider may check for scarlet fever by doing a:Physical examinationThroat culture that shows bacteria from group A streptococcus
   Throat swab to do a test called rapid antigen detection for group A streptococcus ("rapid strep test")Treatment

Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria that cause the throat infection. This is crucial to prevent rheumatic fever, a serious complication of strep throat and scarlet fever.Outlook (Prognosis)

With proper antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of scarlet fever should get better quickly. However, the rash can last for up to 2 to 3 weeks before it fully goes away.Possible Complications

Complications are rare with the right treatment, but may include:Acute rheumatic fever, which can affect the heart, joints, skin, and brainEar infectionKidney damageLiver damagePneumoniaSinus infectionSwollen lymph glands or abscessWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if:You develop symptoms of scarlet feverYour symptoms do not go away 24 hours after beginning antibiotic treatmentYou develop new symptomsPrevention

Bacteria are spread by direct contact with infected people, or by droplets an infected person coughs or exhales. Avoid contact with infected people.Alternative Names

 Labyrinthitis is irritation and swelling of the inner ear. It can cause vertigo and hearing loss.Causes

Labyrinthitis is usually caused by a virus and sometimes by bacteria. Having a cold or flu can trigger the condition. Less often, an ear infection may lead to labyrinthitis. Other causes include allergies or certain medicines that are bad for the inner ear. Your inner ear is important for both hearing and balance. When you have labyrinthitis, the parts of your inner ear become irritated and swollen. This can make you lose your balance and cause hearing loss.These factors raise your risk for labyrinthitis:Drinking large amounts of alcoholFatigueHistory of allergiesRecent viral illness, respiratory infection, or ear infectionSmokingStressUsing certain prescription or nonprescription medicines (such as aspirin) Symptoms

Symptoms may include any of the following:Feeling like you are spinning, even when you are still (vertigo).Your eyes moving on their own, making it hard to focus them.Dizziness.Hearing loss in one ear.Loss of balance -- you may fall toward one side.Nausea and vomiting.Ringing or other noises in your ears (tinnitus). Exams and Tests

Your health care provider may give you a physical exam. You may also have tests of your nervous system (neurological exam).Tests can rule out other causes of your symptoms. These may include:Electronystagmography, and warming and cooling the inner ear with air or water to test eye reflexes (caloric stimulation)Head CT scanHearing testMRI of the headTreatment

Labyrinthitis usually goes away within a few weeks. Treatment can help reduce vertigo and other symptoms. Physical therapy focused on balance can be helpful for some people. Medicines that may help include:AntihistaminesMedicines to control nausea and vomiting, such as prochlorperazineMedicines to relieve dizziness, such as meclizine or scopolamineSedatives, such as diazepam (Valium)CorticosteroidsAntiviral medicines If you have severe vomiting, you may be admitted to the hospital.Follow your provider's instructions for taking care of yourself at home.

 Synovial fluid analysis is a group of tests that examine joint (synovial) fluid. The tests help diagnose and treat joint-related problems.How the Test is Performed

A sample of synovial fluid is needed for this test. Synovial fluid is normally a thick, straw-colored liquid found in small amounts in joints.After the skin around the joint is cleaned, the health care provider inserts a sterile needle through the skin and into the joint space. Fluid is then drawn through the needle into a sterile syringe.The fluid sample is sent to the laboratory. The laboratory technician:Checks the sample's color and how clear it isPlaces the sample under a microscope, counts the number of red and white blood cells, and looks for crystals (in the case of gout) or bacteriaMeasures glucose, protein, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levelsCultures the fluid to see if any bacteria growHow to Prepare for the Test

Normally, no special preparation is needed. Tell your provider if you are taking a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or clopidogrel (Plavix). These medicines can affect test results or your ability to have this test.How the Test will Feel

Most often, the provider will first inject numbing medicine into the skin with a small needle, which will sting. A larger needle is then used to draw out the synovial fluid.This test may also cause some discomfort if the tip of the needle touches bone. The procedure usually lasts less than 1 to 2 minutes. It may be longer if there is a large amount of fluid that needs to be removed.Why the Test is Performed

The test can help diagnose the cause of pain, redness, or swelling in joints.Sometimes, removing the fluid can also help relieve joint pain.This test may be used when your provider suspects:Bleeding in the joint after a joint injuryGout, other types of crystal disease, and arthritisInfection in a jointWhat Abnormal Results Mean

Abnormal joint fluid may look cloudy or abnormally thick.The following found in joint fluid can be a sign of a health problem:Blood -- injury in the joint or bleeding problem of the bodyPus -- infection in the jointToo much joint fluid -- osteoarthritis or cartilage, ligament, or meniscus injuryEvidence of gout or pseudogout -- inflammatory conditions that can be treated with medicinesRisks

Risks of this test include:Infection of the joint -- unusual, but more common with repeated aspirationsBleeding into the joint spaceConsiderations

Ice or cold packs may be applied to the joint for 24 to 36 hours after the test to reduce the swelling and joint pain. Depending on the exact problem, you can probably resume your normal activities after the procedure. Talk to your provider to determine what activity is most appropriate for you.Alternative Names

 Toxic shock syndrome is a serious disease that involves fever, shock, and problems with several body organs.Causes

Toxic shock syndrome is caused by a toxin produced by some types of staphylococcus bacteria. A similar problem, called toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS), can be caused by toxin from streptococcal bacteria. Very few staph or strep infections cause toxic shock syndrome.The earliest cases of toxic shock syndrome involved women who used tampons during their menstrual periods. However, today less than one half of cases are linked to tampon use. Toxic shock syndrome can also occur with skin infections, burns, and after surgery. The condition can also affect children, postmenopausal women, and men.Risk factors include:Recent childbirthInfection with Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), commonly called a staph infectionForeign bodies or packings (such as those used to stop nosebleeds) inside the bodyMenstrual periodRecent surgeryTampon use (with higher risk if you leave one in for a long time)Wound infection after surgery Symptoms

Symptoms include:ConfusionDiarrheaGeneral ill feelingHeadachesHigh fever, sometimes accompanied by chillsLow blood pressureMuscle achesNausea and vomitingOrgan failure (most often kidneys and liver)Redness of eyes, mouth, throatSeizuresWidespread red rash that looks like a sunburn -- skin peeling occurs 1 or 2 weeks after the rash, particularly on the palms of the hand or bottom of the feet Exams and Tests

No single test can diagnose toxic shock syndrome.The health care provider will look for the following factors:FeverLow blood pressureRash that peels after 1 to 2 weeksProblems with the function of at least 3 organs In some cases, blood cultures may be positive for growth of S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.Treatment

Treatment includes:Removal of materials, such as tampons, vaginal sponges, or nasal packingDrainage of infection sites (such as a surgical wound) The goal of treatment is to maintain important body functions. This may include:Antibiotics for any infection (may be given through an IV)Dialysis (if severe kidney problems are present)Fluids through a vein (IV)Medicines to control blood pressureIntravenous gamma globulin in severe casesStaying in the hospital intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring Outlook (Prognosis)

Toxic shock syndrome may be deadly in up to 50% of cases. The condition may return in those who survive.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Organ damage including kidney, heart, and liver failureShockDeath When to Contact a Medical Professional

Toxic shock syndrome is a medical emergency. Seek medical help right away if you develop a rash, fever, and feel ill, particularly during menstruation and tampon use or if you have had recent surgery.Prevention

You can lower your risk for menstrual toxic shock syndrome by:Avoiding highly absorbent tamponsChanging tampons frequently (at least every 8 hours)Only using tampons once in awhile during menstruation Alternative Names

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome; Toxic shock-like syndrome; TSLSImages

Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. They will give you further instructions.This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.What to Expect at the Emergency Room

Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.People who have been poisoned by diazinon will likely be treated by first responders (firefighters, paramedics) who arrive when you call 911 or your local emergency number. These responders will decontaminate the person by removing the person's clothes and washing them down with water. The responders will wear protective gear. If the person is not decontaminated before getting to the hospital, emergency room personnel will decontaminate the person and provide other treatment. The health care providers at the hospital will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:Blood and urine testsBreathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machineChest x-rayCT (computerized tomography) scan of the headECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing)Intravenous fluids (through a vein)Medicines to reverse the effects of the poisonTube placed down the nose and into the stomach (sometimes)Washing of the skin (irrigation) and eyes, perhaps every few hours for several days Outlook (Prognosis)

People who continue to improve over the first 4 to 6 hours after receiving medical treatment usually recover. Prolonged treatment often is needed to reverse the poisoning. This may include staying in the hospital intensive care unit and getting long-term therapy. Some effects of the poison may last for weeks or months, or even longer.Keep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk of poisoning and overdose.Alternative Names

 Primary amyloidosis is a rare disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits.Causes

The cause of primary amyloidosis is not well understood. Genes may play a role.The condition is related to abnormal and excess production of specific proteins. The proteins build up in certain organs. This makes it harder for the organs to work correctly.Primary amyloidosis can lead to conditions that include:Carpal tunnel syndromeÂ (due to protein deposits in the nerve)Heart muscle damage (cardiomyopathy) leading to congestive heart failureIntestinal malabsorptionLiver swelling and malfunctionKidney failureNephrotic syndrome (group of symptoms that includes protein in the urine, low protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and swelling throughout the body)Nerve problems (neuropathy)Orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure when you stand up) Symptoms

Symptoms depend on the organs affected. This disease can affect many organs and tissues, including the tongue, intestines, skeletal and smooth muscles, nerves, skin, ligaments, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and bladder.Symptoms may include any of the following:Abnormal heart rhythmFatigueNumbness of hands or feetShortness of breathSkin changesSwallowing problemsSwelling in the arms and legsSwollen tongueWeak hand gripWeight loss or weight gain Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:Decreased urine outputDiarrheaHoarseness or changing voiceJoint painWeakness Exams and Tests

The health care provider will examine you. You will be asked about your medical history and symptoms. A physical exam may show that you have a swollen liver or spleen, or signs of heart or nerve damage.The first step in diagnosing amyloidosis should be blood and urine tests to look for abnormal proteins.Other tests depend on your symptoms and the organ that may be affected. Some tests include:Abdominal ultrasound to check the liver and spleenHeart tests, such as an ECG, ECHO, or MRIKidney function tests to check for signs of kidney damage (nephrotic syndrome or renal insufficiency) Tests that can help confirm the diagnosis include:Abdominal fat pad aspirationBone marrow biopsyHeart muscle biopsyRectal mucosa biopsy Treatment

Treatment may include:ChemotherapyStem cell transplantOrgan transplantIf the condition is caused by another disease, that disease should be aggressively treated. This may improve symptoms or slow the disease from getting worse. Complications such as heart failure, kidney failure, and other problems can sometimes be treated, when needed.Outlook (Prognosis)

How well you do depends on which organs are affected. Heart and kidney involvement may lead to organ failure and death. Body-wide (systemic) amyloidosis can lead to death within 2 years. When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of this disease. Also call if you have been diagnosed with this disease and have:Decreased urinationDifficulty breathingSwelling of the ankles or other body parts that does not go awayPrevention

There is no known prevention for primary amyloidosis.Alternative Names

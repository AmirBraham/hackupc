 Subconjunctival hemorrhage is a bright red patch appearing in the white of the eye. This condition is one of several disorders called red eye.Causes

The white of the eye (sclera) is covered with a thin layer of clear tissue called the bulbar conjunctiva. A subconjunctival hemorrhage occurs when a small blood vessel breaks open and bleeds within the conjunctiva. The blood is often very visible, but since it is confined within the conjunctiva, it does not move and cannot be wiped away. The problem may occur without injury. It is often first noticed when you wake up and look in a mirror.Some things that may cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage include:Sudden increases in pressure in the head or neck, such as violent sneezing or coughingHaving high blood pressure or taking blood thinnersRubbing the eyesViral infectionCertain eye surgeries or injuriesA subconjunctival hemorrhage is common in newborn infants. In this case, the condition is thought to be caused by the pressure changes across the infant's body during childbirth.Symptoms

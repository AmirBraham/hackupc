 Neurocognitive disorder is a general term that describes decreased mental function due to a medical disease other than a psychiatric illness.Neurocognitive disorders are grouped into three subcategories:Delirium.Mild neurocognitive disorder - some decreased mental function, but able to stay independent and do daily tasks.Major neurocognitive disorder - decreased mental function and loss of ability to do daily tasks. Also called dementia.Causes

Listed below are conditions associated with neurocognitive disorder.BRAIN INJURY CAUSED BY TRAUMABleeding into the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage)Bleeding into the space around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage)Blood clot inside the skull but outside the brain and its covering, which may cause pressure on the brain (subdural or epidural hematoma)ConcussionBREATHING CONDITIONSLow oxygen in the body (hypoxia)High carbon dioxide level in the body (hypercapnia) CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS Dementia due to many strokes (multi-infarct dementia)Heart infections (endocarditis, myocarditis)StrokeTransient ischemic attack (TIA) DEGENERATIVE DISORDERSAlzheimer disease (also called senile dementia, Alzheimer type)Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseDiffuse Lewy body diseaseHuntington diseaseMultiple sclerosisNormal pressure hydrocephalusParkinson diseasePick diseaseDEMENTIA DUE TO METABOLIC CAUSESKidney diseaseLiver diseaseThyroid disease (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism)Vitamin deficiency (B1, B12, or folate) DRUG AND ALCOHOL-RELATED CONDITIONSAlcohol withdrawal stateIntoxication from drug or alcohol useMedicine effect, such as corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, and antidepressantsWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a long-term effect of deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1)Withdrawal from drugs, such as sedative-hypnotics and corticosteroidsINFECTIONSAny sudden onset (acute) or long-term (chronic) infectionBlood poisoning (septicemia)Brain infection (encephalitis)Meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord)Prion infections, such as mad cow diseaseLate-stage syphilis Complications of cancer and cancer treatment with chemotherapy can also lead to neurocognitive disorder.Other conditions that may mimic organic brain syndrome include:DepressionNeurosisPsychosisSymptoms

Symptoms can differ based on the disease. In general, organic brain syndrome causes:AgitationConfusionLong-term loss of brain function (dementia)Severe, short-term loss of brain function (delirium) Exams and Tests

Tests depend on the disorder, but may include:
  Blood tests
  Neuropsychological testingElectroencephalogram (EEG)
  Head CT scanHead MRIÂ Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)Treatment

Treatment depends on the underlying condition. Many conditions are treated mainly with rehabilitation and supportive care to help the person with activities lost due to areas where brain function is affected.Medicines may be needed to reduce aggressive behaviors that can occur with some of the conditions.Outlook (Prognosis)

Some disorders are short-term and reversible. But many are long-term or get worse over time.Possible Complications

People with neurocognitive disorder often lose the ability to interact with others or function on their own. When to Contact a Medical Professional

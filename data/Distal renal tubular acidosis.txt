 Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis).Causes

When the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood becomes too acidic. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells.The kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine.Distal renal tubular acidosis (type I RTA) is caused by a defect in the kidney tubes that causes acid to build up in the blood.Type I RTA is caused by a variety of conditions, including:Amyloidosis, a buildup of abnormal protein, called amyloid, in the tissues and organsFabry disease, an abnormal buildup in the body of a certain type of fatty substanceHigh level of calcium in the bloodSickle cell disease, red blood cells that are normally shaped like a disk take on a sickle or crescent shapeSj√∂gren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyedSystemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissueWilson disease, an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissuesUse of certain medicines, such as amphotericin B, lithium, and analgesicsSymptoms

Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include any of the following: Confusion or decreased alertnessFatigueImpaired growth in childrenIncreased breathing rateKidney stonesNephrocalcinosis (too much calcium deposited in the kidneys)Osteomalacia (softening of the bones)Muscle weakness Other symptoms may include:Bone painDecreased urine outputIncreased heart rate or irregular heartbeatMuscle crampsPain in the back, flank, or abdomenSkeletal abnormalities Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.Tests that may be ordered include:Arterial blood gasBlood chemistryUrine pHAcid-load testBicarbonate infusion testUrinalysisCalcium deposits in the kidneys and kidney stones may be seen on:X-raysUltrasoundCT scan Treatment

The goal is to restore normal acid level and electrolyte balance in the body. This will help correct bone disorders and reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) and kidney stones.The underlying cause of distal renal tubular acidosis should be corrected if it can be identified.Medicines that may be prescribed include potassium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, and thiazide diuretics. These are alkaline medicines that help correct the acidic condition of the body. Sodium bicarbonate may correct the loss of potassium and calcium.Outlook (Prognosis)

The disorder must be treated to reduce its effects and complications, which can be permanent or life threatening. Most cases get better with treatment.When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you have symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis.Get medical help right away if you develop emergency symptoms such as:Decreased consciousnessSeizuresSevere decrease in alertness or orientationPrevention

There is no prevention for this disorder.Alternative Names

Renal tubular acidosis - distal; Renal tubular acidosis type I; Type I RTA; RTA - distal; Classical RTAImages

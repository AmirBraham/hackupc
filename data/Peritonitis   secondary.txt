 The peritoneum is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen. Peritonitis is present when this tissue becomes inflamed or infected. Secondary peritonitis is when another condition is the cause.Causes

Secondary peritonitis has several major causes.Bacteria may enter the peritoneum through a hole (perforation) in an organ of the digestive tract. The hole may be caused by a ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer, or perforated colon. It may also come from an injury, such as a gunshot or knife wound or following the ingestion of a sharp foreign body.Bile or chemicals released by the pancreas may leak into the abdominal cavity. This may be caused by swelling and inflammation of the pancreas called pancreatitis.Tubes or catheters placed into the abdomen may cause this problem. These include catheters for peritoneal dialysis, feeding tubes, and others.An infection of the bloodstream (sepsis) may lead to an infection in the abdomen also. This is a severe illness.This tissue may become infected when there is no clear cause.Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies and can lead to peritonitis. This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or born early.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Swollen abdomenÂ when your belly area is bigger than usualAbdominal painDecreased appetiteFeverLow urine outputNauseaThirstVomitingNote: There may be signs of shock.Exams and Tests

During a physical exam, the health care provider may notice abnormal vital signs with fever, rapid heart rate and breathing, low blood pressure, and a tender distended abdomen.Tests may include:Blood cultureBlood chemistry, including pancreatic enzymesComplete blood countLiver and kidney function testsX-rays or CT scanPeritoneal fluid cultureUrinalysis Treatment

Often, surgery is needed to remove or treat sources of infection. These may be an infected bowel, an inflamed appendix, or an abscess or perforated diverticulum, usually due to diverticulitis.General treatment includes:AntibioticsFluids through a vein (IV)Pain medicinesTube through the nose into the stomach or intestine (nasogastric or NG tube) Outlook (Prognosis)

The outcome can range from complete recovery to overwhelming infection and death. Factors that determine the outcome include:How long the symptoms were present before treatment beganThe person's general health Possible Complications

Complications may include:AbscessGangrene (dead) bowel requiring surgeryIntraperitoneal adhesions (a potential cause of future bowel blockage)Septic shockWhen to Contact a Medical Professional

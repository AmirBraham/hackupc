Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. They will give you further instructions.This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.What to Expect at the Emergency Room

Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.People with malathion poisoning will likely be treated by first responders (firefighters, paramedics) who arrive when you call your local emergency number. These responders will decontaminate the person by removing the person's clothes and washing them down with water. The responders will wear protective gear. If the person is not decontaminated before getting to the hospital, emergency room personnel will decontaminate the person and provide other treatment.The health care provider at the hospital will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:Blood and urine testsOxygenBreathing support, including tube through the mouth and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator)Chest x-rayCT (computerized tomography) scan of the headECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing)Intravenous fluids (fluids given through a vein)Medicine to reverse the effects of the poison, which may include atropine or pralidoximeTube placed down the nose and into the stomach (sometimes)Washing of the skin (irrigation) and eyes, perhaps every few hours for several daysOutlook (Prognosis)

People who continue to improve in the first 4 to 6 hours after receiving medical treatment usually recover. Prolonged treatment often is needed to reverse the poisoning. This may include staying in the hospital intensive care unit and getting long-term therapy. Some effects of the poison may last for weeks or months, or even longer.Keep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk of poisoning and overdose.Alternative Names

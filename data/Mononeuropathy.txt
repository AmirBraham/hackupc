 Mononeuropathy is damage to a single nerve, which results in loss of movement, sensation, or other function of that nerve.Causes

Mononeuropathy is a type of damage to a nerve outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral neuropathy).Mononeuropathy is most often caused by injury. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.Long-term pressure on a nerve due to swelling or injury can result in mononeuropathy. The covering of the nerve (myelin sheath) or part of the nerve cell (the axon) may be damaged. This damage slows or prevents signals from traveling through the damaged nerves.Mononeuropathy may involve any part of the body. Some common forms of mononeuropathy include:Axillary nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in the shoulder)
   Common peroneal nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in the foot and leg)
   Carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve dysfunction -- including numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers)
   
   Cranial mononeuropathy III, IV, compression or diabetic type
   Cranial mononeuropathy VI (double vision)Cranial mononeuropathy VII (facial paralysis)Femoral nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in part of the leg)Radial nerve dysfunction (problems with movement in the arm and wrist and with sensation in the back of the arm or hand)Sciatic nerve dysfunction (problem with the muscles of the back of the knee and lower leg, and sensation to the back of the thigh, part of the lower leg, and sole of the foot)Ulnar nerve dysfunction (cubital tunnel syndrome -- including numbness, tingling, weakness of outer and underside of arm, palm, ring and little fingers)Symptoms

Symptoms depend on the specific nerve affected, and may include:Loss of sensationParalysisTingling, burning, pain, abnormal sensationsWeaknessExams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam and focus on the affected area. A detailed medical history is needed to determine the possible cause of the disorder.Tests that may be done include:Electromyogram (EMG) to check the electrical activity in the musclesNerve conduction tests (NCV) to check the speed of electrical activity in the nervesNerve ultrasound to view the nervesX-ray, MRI or CT scan to get an overall view of the affected areaBlood testsNerve biopsy (in case of mononeuropathy due to vasculitis)CSF examinationSkin biopsyTreatment

The goal of treatment is to allow you to use the affected body part as much as possible.Some medical conditions make nerves more prone to injury. For example, high blood pressure and diabetes can injure an artery, which can often affect a single nerve. So, the underlying condition should be treated.Treatment options may include any of the following:Over the counter painkillers, such as anti-inflammatory medicines for mild painAntidepressants, anticonvulsants, and similar medicines for chronic painInjections of steroid medicines to reduce swelling and pressure on the nerveSurgery to relieve pressure on the nervePhysical therapy exercises to maintain muscle strengthBraces, splints, or other devices to help with movementTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to improve nerve pain associated with diabetesOutlook (Prognosis)

Mononeuropathy may be disabling and painful. If the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be found and successfully treated, a full recovery is possible in some cases.Nerve pain may be uncomfortable and last for a long time.Possible Complications

Complications may include:Deformity, loss of tissue massMedicine side effectsRepeated or unnoticed injury to the affected area due to lack of sensationPrevention

Avoiding pressure or traumatic injury may prevent many forms of mononeuropathy. Treating conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes also decreases the risk of developing the condition.Alternative Names

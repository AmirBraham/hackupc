 A voiding cystourethrogram is an x-ray study of the bladder and urethra. It is done while the bladder is emptying. How the Test is Performed

The test is performed in a hospital radiology department or in a health care provider's office. You will lie on your back on the x-ray table. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) and passed into the bladder.Contrast dye flows through the catheter into the bladder. This dye helps the bladder show up better on x-ray images.The x-rays are taken from various angles while the bladder is full of contrast dye. The catheter is removed so that you can urinate. Images are taken while you empty your bladder.How to Prepare for the Test

You must sign a consent form. You will be given a gown to wear.Remove all jewelry before the test. Inform the provider if you are:Allergic to any medicinesAllergic to x-ray contrast materialPregnantHow the Test will Feel

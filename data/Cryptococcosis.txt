C neoformans and C gattii are the fungi that cause this disease. Infection with C neoformans is seen worldwide. Infection with C gattii has mainly been seen in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, British Columbia in Canada, Southeast Asia, and Australia. In the United States, sporadic cases have been seen in many states including Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Hawaii, Georgia, Rhode Island, and Florida. Cryptococcus is the most common fungus that causes serious infection worldwide.Both types of fungi are found in soil. If you breathe the fungus in, it infects your lungs. The infection may go away on its own, remain in the lungs only, or spread throughout the body (disseminate). C neoformans infection is most often seen in people with a weak immune system, such as those who:Are infected with HIV/AIDSTake corticosteroid medicinesCancerAre on chemotherapy medicines for cancerHave Hodgkin diseaseHave had an organ transplantC gattii may affect people with normal immune system.C neoformans is the most common life-threatening cause of fungal infection in people with HIV/AIDS.People between 20 to 40 years of age are the most common age group that has this infection.

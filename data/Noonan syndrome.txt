 Noonan syndrome is a disease present from birth (congenital) that causes many parts of the body to develop abnormally. In some cases it is passed down through families (inherited).Causes

Noonan syndrome is linked to defects in several genes. In general, certain proteins involved in growth and development become overactive as a result of these gene changes.Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. This means only one parent has to pass down the nonworking gene for the child to have the syndrome. However, some cases may not be inherited.Symptoms

Symptoms include:Delayed pubertyDown-slanting or wide-set eyesHearing loss (varies)Low-set or abnormally shaped earsMild intellectual disability (only in about 25% of cases)Sagging eyelids (ptosis)Short statureSmall penisUndescended testiclesUnusual chest shape (most often a sunken chest called pectus excavatum)Webbed and short-appearing neck Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show signs of heart problems the infant had from birth. These may include pulmonary stenosis and atrial septal defect.Tests depend on the symptoms, but may include:Platelet countBlood clotting factor testECG, chest x-ray, or echocardiogramHearing testsGrowth hormone levels Renal ultrasoundGenetic testing can help diagnose this syndrome.Treatment

There is no specific treatment. Your provider will suggest treatment to relieve or manage symptoms. Growth hormone has been used successfully to treat short height in some people with Noonan syndrome.Support Groups

Complications may include:Abnormal bleeding or bruisingBuildup of fluid in tissues of body (lymphedema, cystic hygroma)Failure to thrive in infantsLeukemia and other cancersLow self-esteemInfertility in males if both testes are undescendedProblems with the structure of the heartShort heightSocial problems due to physical symptoms When to Contact a Medical Professional

This condition may be found during early infant exams. A geneticist is often needed to diagnose Noonan syndrome.Prevention

Couples with a family history of Noonan syndrome may want to consider genetic counseling before having children.Images

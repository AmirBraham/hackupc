The venom of the black widow spider contains toxic chemicals, including the neurotoxin alpha latrotoxin, that make people sick.Where Found

Black widow spiders are found throughout the United States, mostly in the South and West. They are usually found in barns, sheds, stone walls, fences, woodpiles, porch furniture, and other outdoor structures. They are usually, but not always, found near ground level, or within a few feet of the ground. They make irregular, asymmetrical, "disorganized" looking webs.This genus of spider species is found worldwide. They are most plentiful in temperate and subtropical climates, especially during the summer months, and are common throughout the southern United States.Wear protective clothing when traveling through areas where these spiders live. DO NOT put your hands or feet in their nests or in their preferred hiding places, such as dark, sheltered areas under logs or underbrush, or other damp, moist areas.Symptoms

The first symptom of a black widow bite is usually pain similar to a pinprick. This is felt when the bite is made. Some people may not feel it. Minor swelling, redness, and a target-shaped sore may appear.After 15 minutes to 1 hour, a dull muscle pain spreads from the bite area to the whole body.If the bite is on the upper body, you will usually feel most of the pain in your chest.If the bite is on your lower body, you will usually feel most of the pain in your abdomen. The following symptoms can also occur:AnxietyDifficulty breathingHeadacheHigh blood pressureIncreased salivaIncreased sweatingLight sensitivityMuscle weaknessNausea and vomitingNumbness and tingling around the bite site, then sometimes spreading out from the biteRestlessnessSeizures (usually seen just before death in children who are bitten)Very painful muscle cramps or spasmsFacial swelling in the hours after the bite (This pattern of swelling is sometimes confused with an allergy to the drug used in treatment.) Pregnant women may have contractions and go into labor.Home Care

Black widow spider bites are very toxic. Seek medical help right away. Call the Poison Control Center for guidance.Follow these steps until medical help is given:Clean the area with soap and water.Wrap ice in a clean cloth and place it on the bite area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. A homemade splint may be helpful if the bite was on the arms, legs, hands, or feet.Loosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.Before Calling Emergency
